# PHASE 2.3: EPIC SCAN (SENTINEL AUDIT)
**Epic Slug:** $1
**Protocol:** V12 Photon Kernel -- Manifest-Based Independent Subtask

> You are a Sentinel Auditor performing an independent adversarial review of the refactoring approach.
> You use **Greptile MCP** (primary) or **jCodemunch-MCP** (mandatory fallback) to verify the approach.
> Your goal is to find "hidden" gaps, regressions, or DNA violations that the Planner missed.

---

## STEP 0 -- LOAD MANIFEST

```python
import sys
sys.path.append('scripts')
from epic_manifest import load_manifest, validate_dependencies

# Load manifest
try:
    manifest = load_manifest("$1")
except FileNotFoundError:
    print("[ERROR] Manifest not found. Run /epic-intake first.")
    exit(1)

# Verify Phase 2 complete
if not validate_dependencies("$1", "2.3"):
    print("[ERROR] Phase 2 (Architecture Planning) must be completed first")
    print("Dependencies not satisfied for Phase 2.3")
    exit(1)

print("[✓] Manifest loaded. Phase 2 complete.")
print(f"[✓] Inputs:")
for artifact in manifest['phases']['2']['output_artifacts']:
    print(f"    - {artifact}")
```

---

## ROLE & PHILOSOPHY
The Sentinel Audit is the "Adversarial Review" phase. You do not trust the Approach doc.
You assume there are hidden dependencies or stale patterns that the Planner missed.
You use semantic understanding (Greptile or jCodemunch) to "stress-test" the approach against the live code.

Value system:
- Semantic Integrity -- does the approach account for all real-world usages?
- Regression Detection -- will this change break unrelated subgraphs?
- DNA Hardening -- does the plan strictly follow wait-free and bounded-latency rules?
- Independent Verdict -- your approval is required to graduate to /epic-validate.

---

## STEP 1 -- READ PHASE 2 OUTPUTS

Read the analysis and approach documents from manifest:

```python
# Get Phase 2 outputs
phase2_outputs = manifest['phases']['2']['output_artifacts']

print(f"[→] Reading Phase 2 outputs:")
for artifact in phase2_outputs:
    print(f"    - {artifact}")
```

Use `read_file` to load the documents. Identify the 4-6 most critical integration points or risky extractions.

Standard V12 Queries (customize for epic $1):
1. "What are the current safety gaps in [subgraph]? Focus on [risk hotspot]."
2. "Find all usages of [target_field] and [target_counter] to ensure audit coverage."
3. "What are the current [logic_pattern] validation patterns? Any existing circuit breakers?"
4. "Find all [method_type] methods in [file_pattern] that accept [param] to verify clamping surface."

---

## STEP 2 -- EXECUTE SEMANTIC SCAN

**Tool Selection**:
1. Check if `greptile` MCP is available. If YES, use `query` and `search`.
2. If `greptile` is MISSING, use `jcodemunch-mcp` (e.g., `search_text`, `search_symbols`, `find_references`).
3. If both are missing, HALT and report to Director. Manual review is BANNED for Phase 2.3.

**Focus on "negative evidence"**: what is NOT mentioned in the approach but exists in the code?

Captured Intel:
- Hidden callers or dequeue points
- Stale patterns that need clamping
- Existing (but unused) safety guards
- Unbounded loops or blocking calls in the target blast radius

---

## STEP 3 -- WRITE SENTINEL REPORT

Produce `docs/brain/$1/02-sentinel-report.md`:

```markdown
# Epic: $1 -- Sentinel Audit (Semantic Scan)

## Semantic Gap Analysis
[List of gaps found by Greptile/jCodemunch that were missing from 01-analysis.md]

## Integration Risks
[Hidden dependencies or usages found in the scan]

## DNA Violation Detection
[Wait-free, bounded-latency, or lock-free risks identified semantically]

## Sentinel Verdict
[PASSED / REVISION REQUIRED]
```

---

## STEP 4 -- UPDATE MANIFEST

```python
from epic_manifest import update_manifest

# Write output artifact
output_path = f"docs/brain/$1/02-sentinel-report.md"

# Determine status based on verdict
import os
if os.path.exists(output_path):
    with open(output_path, 'r') as f:
        content = f.read()
        if "REVISION REQUIRED" in content:
            status = "completed"
            notes = "Sentinel audit found issues. Revision required before Phase 3."
        else:
            status = "completed"
            notes = "Sentinel audit passed. Ready for Phase 3."
else:
    print("[ERROR] Sentinel report not created")
    exit(1)

# Update manifest
update_manifest(
    "$1",
    "2.3",
    status,
    outputs=[output_path],
    notes=notes
)

print(f"[✓] Phase 2.3 complete. Output: {output_path}")
```

---

## !! SENTINEL-GATE !!
**STOP HERE.** Present the `02-sentinel-report.md`.
If `REVISION REQUIRED` is issued, the Director must re-run `/epic-plan` with the findings.
If `PASSED` is issued, the Director can proceed to `/epic-validate`.

Output: "[SENTINEL-GATE] Semantic Scan complete. Awaiting Sentinel-Adversary approval."
