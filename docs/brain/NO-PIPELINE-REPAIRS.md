## HOTFIX-B66-ATM-TPL

**ID**: HOTFIX-B66-ATM-TPL
**Date**: 2026-08-17
**File**: `src/PropTraderTools/TradeCopierPanel.cs`
**Method**: `GetLeaderAtmTemplateName(Chart currentChart)` (line 2207)
**Status**: PIPELINE-COMPLETE (B75-LaneB)

### Bug
`GetLeaderAtmTemplateName` used `FindVisualChildByIndex<ComboBox>(ct, 2)` to find the ATM
template ComboBox in ChartTrader (index 0 = Instrument, 1 = Account, assumed 2 = ATM).
PTT panel injects its own ComboBoxes (`_followersDropDown`, per-follower ATM combos) into the
ChartTrader Grid, shifting the native ATM ComboBox from index 2 to a higher index.
Result: `GetLeaderAtmTemplateName` returned `string.Empty` every time.
`OnCloneModeClick` stored empty string into `_cloneAtmCache`.
`GetCloneAtmMode` returned `FollowerAtmMode.Inherit` (no template) -- follower got a bare Limit
order (`SendCopy`) instead of `SendCopyWithAtm` + `StartAtmStrategy` + ATM brackets.
Confirmed by DIAG-CLONE-01 log: `[PTT-CLONE] SetCloneAtmCache: '' (empty=True)`.

### Fix (v2 -- direct property)
Primary path replaced with `ct.AtmStrategy?.Name` -- `ChartTrader.AtmStrategy` is a direct
property returning the currently selected `AtmStrategy` object; `.Name` is the template name.
Confirmed from NT8 community forum topics 5133 and 6060 (multiple independent developers).
No child walk, no index fragility, no injected-ComboBox interference.
Fallback-1: `FindVisualChild<AtmStrategySelector>` by type (covers unusual builds).
Fallback-2: original `FindVisualChildByIndex<ComboBox>(ct, 2)` (legacy pre-B66 path).

### Fix (v1 -- superseded by v2 above)
`FindVisualChild<AtmStrategySelector>` by type was primary in v1. Superseded because
`ct.AtmStrategy` is simpler, more direct, and confirmed by NT8 community as the canonical path.

### NT8_FULL_REFERENCE.md update
Added `ChartTrader Class` section documenting `.AtmStrategy`, `.Account`, `.Quantity`,
`.Instrument` properties, access patterns (Indicator vs. AddOn), thread safety, and comparison
table of three ATM template lookup approaches.

### Expected behavior after fix
Clone radio click -> `GetLeaderAtmTemplateName` reads `ct.AtmStrategy?.Name` ->
`SetCloneAtmCache` stores the real template name (e.g. "MES $200 SL6") ->
`GetCloneAtmMode` returns `FollowerAtmMode.Named("MES $200 SL6")` ->
`ResolveAtmMode` returns Named mode -> `DispatchCopy` calls `SendCopyWithAtm` ->
follower gets `"Entry"` order + `StartAtmStrategy` + ATM brackets.

### JS-DNA compliance
- No `lock()` added ✅
- No `throw new` added ✅
- No `return null` added (all paths return `string.Empty`) ✅
- No `async void` added ✅

### Diff (minimal -- v2 primary change)
```diff
-                var atmCb = TradeCopierAddOn.FindVisualChildByIndex<ComboBox>(ct, 2);
-                if (atmCb == null) return string.Empty;
-                return atmCb.SelectedItem as string ?? string.Empty;
+                if (ct.AtmStrategy != null)
+                    return ct.AtmStrategy.Name ?? string.Empty;
+                var sel = TradeCopierAddOn.FindVisualChild<NinjaTrader.NinjaScript.AtmStrategy.AtmStrategySelector>(ct);
+                if (sel?.SelectedAtmStrategy != null)
+                    return sel.SelectedAtmStrategy.Name ?? string.Empty;
+                var atmCb = TradeCopierAddOn.FindVisualChildByIndex<ComboBox>(ct, 2);
+                return atmCb?.SelectedItem as string ?? string.Empty;
```

### Pipeline work needed (block BXX-LaneB)
- Ph1 Architecture: document ChartTrader.AtmStrategy as canonical template source
- Ph3 DNA: verify no other callers use FindVisualChildByIndex<ComboBox>(..., 2) for ATM reads
- Ph3.5 Tickets: tests for GetLeaderAtmTemplateName:
  - T_B66TPL_01: null chart -> string.Empty
  - T_B66TPL_02: ChartTrader not found -> string.Empty
  - T_B66TPL_03: ct.AtmStrategy non-null -> returns .Name
  - T_B66TPL_04: ct.AtmStrategy null, AtmStrategySelector found -> returns SelectedAtmStrategy.Name
  - T_B66TPL_05: all null -> string.Empty (not throw)

**DIAG-MOVESTOP-01**: All `Output.Process("[MSTBE]...")` log lines removed from `MoveStopToBreakEven` (2026-08-17 pre-flight, synced).

**B72-LaneA gap note**: `ticket-1-completion.md` absent from B72-LaneA directory (noted by B73 Ph5 reviewer). Code artifact (`CopyEngine.cs`, `PttBreakEven.cs`, test files) is present and verified. This is a pipeline documentation gap only — no functional defect. Director should ensure `ticket-1-completion.md` is written retroactively.

## ALL HOTFIXES BELOW: PIPELINE-COMPLETE (B72 / B73 / B74)

The following entries were formalised through the full 7-phase PTT pipeline.
No further pipeline action required unless a regression is identified.

## HOTFIX-BE-ALL-01

**Date**: 2026-08-14 (live trading session)
**File**: `src/PropTraderTools/CopyEngine.cs`
**Method**: `ArmAllPendingBe(int bufferTicks)` (line 563)
**Status**: APPLIED — awaiting pipeline

### Bug
`ArmAllPendingBe` was calling `SubmitBeStop(acc, pos.Instrument, bePrice, isLong)` which:
1. Created a brand-new `PTT-BE-Stop` StopMarket order immediately (no wait for price trigger)
2. Never wrote to `_pendingBeSlots` so `IsPendingSlotsEmpty()` always returned `true`
3. Result: BE All panel button always stayed purple (never armed), and a new stop order
   stacked on top of existing ATM brackets without cancelling them first (double-stop bug)
4. Followers were never touched (their stops were never moved)

### Fix
Replaced `SubmitBeStop(...)` call with `ArmPendingBe(pos.Instrument, acc, bufferTicks)`.
This is exactly the path used by the per-chart BE button for a single account.

When the price trigger fires:
- `OnPendingBeAccountUpdate` fires for the leader
- Calls `BreakEven(leader, instrument, bufferTicks)`
- `BreakEven(Account,...)` fans out via `AllAccounts(instrument)` -> `MoveStopToBreakEven`
- `MoveStopToBreakEven` moves existing stops in-place via `acc.Change()` for both
  leader AND all followers in the copy rule

### Expected behavior after fix
- Press BE All while in drawdown: button turns amber (pending slots are now populated)
- When price reaches entry: all leader + follower stops move to BE price in-place
- Press BE All again: disarms (turns purple), pending slots cleared
- No new `PTT-BE-Stop` StopMarket order created (stops are moved in-place, not replaced)

### JS-DNA compliance
- No `lock()` added ✅
- No `throw new` added ✅
- No `return null` added ✅
- `ArmPendingBe` already ConcurrentDictionary-based (lock-free) ✅

### Diff (minimal)
```diff
-                    bool isLong = pos.MarketPosition == MarketPosition.Long;
-                    double tick = pos.Instrument.MasterInstrument?.TickSize ?? 0.25;
-                    double bePrice = Math.Round(
-                        (pos.AveragePrice + (isLong ? bufferTicks : -bufferTicks) * tick) / tick
-                    ) * tick;
-                    SubmitBeStop(acc, pos.Instrument, bePrice, isLong);
+                    ArmPendingBe(pos.Instrument, acc, bufferTicks); // HOTFIX-BE-ALL-01
```

### Pipeline work needed (block BXX-LaneA)
- Ph1 Architecture: document the ArmAllPendingBe/SubmitBeStop vs ArmPendingBe design decision
- Ph2 Review: confirm `MoveStopToBreakEven` follower fan-out path works for ATM bracket stops
  (IsStopLeg filter at line 1880 -- need to verify ATM Stop1/Stop2 pass this filter)
- Ph3.5 Tickets: add 4 new tests:
  - T_BEALL_01: `ArmAllPendingBe` with 1 non-follower account -> `_pendingBeSlots` populated
  - T_BEALL_02: `ArmAllPendingBe` with follower account -> slot NOT added (skipped)
  - T_BEALL_03: `ArmAllPendingBe` with flat account -> slot NOT added (ArmPendingBe flat guard)
  - T_BEALL_04: `IsPendingSlotsEmpty` returns false after `ArmAllPendingBe` with open position
- Ph4 Verify: confirm no regression to per-chart BE button (separate path, untouched)

### Open question resolved (DW-BEALL-01 — CLOSED)
`MoveStopToBreakEven` uses `IsStopLeg(order)` filter (line 1880).
`IsStopLeg` (line 1780): returns true if `order.Name.StartsWith("Stop")`.
ATM bracket stops are named `Stop1` and `Stop2` — both start with "Stop". ✅
Follower ATM bracket stops WILL be moved by `MoveStopToBreakEven`. No pipeline gap here.

## HOTFIX-QX-DOUBLE-01

**Date**: 2026-08-14 (live trading session)
**Files**: `src/PropTraderTools/CopyEngine.cs`, `src/PropTraderTools/Features/PttBreakEven.cs`
**Methods**: `CancelQxBrackets` (CopyEngine.cs line ~454), `CancelStaleBracketsLocal` (PttBreakEven.cs line ~159)
**Status**: APPLIED — awaiting pipeline
**Deferred item**: DW-B72-01

### Bug
Clicking Quick All (or BE button) immediately after an ATM strategy fills leaves ATM bracket
orders in `OrderState.TriggerPending` state — "Order is pending submission" per
NT8_FULL_REFERENCE.md line 946. Neither `CancelQxBrackets` nor `CancelStaleBracketsLocal`
included `TriggerPending` in their `stateOk` filter, so the cancels silently skipped
those brackets. New PTT-QX orders were then placed on top → two sets of brackets on the account.

The same root cause also affects any other button (Quick per-chart, BE per-chart) that
calls either cancel helper before placing new orders.

### State coverage before fix

| State | `CancelQxBrackets` | `CancelStaleBracketsLocal` |
|-------|--------------------|---------------------------|
| TriggerPending | ❌ MISSING | ❌ MISSING |
| Initialized | ✅ | ✅ |
| Submitted | ✅ (B71) | ❌ MISSING |
| Accepted | ✅ | ❌ MISSING |
| Working | ✅ | ✅ |

### Fix
Added `OrderState.TriggerPending` to `CancelQxBrackets` stateOk filter (1 line).
Added `OrderState.TriggerPending`, `Submitted`, `Accepted` to `CancelStaleBracketsLocal`
stateOk filter (3 lines) — brings it to parity with `CancelQxBrackets`.
NT8 reference: NT8_FULL_REFERENCE.md line 946.

### JS-DNA compliance
- No `lock()` added ✅
- No `throw new` added ✅
- No `return null` added ✅
- CYC unchanged (Roslyn counts the full `||` chain as 1 decision point in one `if`) ✅

### Diff (minimal)

**CopyEngine.cs — CancelQxBrackets**:
```diff
 bool stateOk = o.OrderState == OrderState.Working
             || o.OrderState == OrderState.Initialized
             || o.OrderState == OrderState.Accepted
-            || o.OrderState == OrderState.Submitted;  // B71
+            || o.OrderState == OrderState.Submitted      // B71
+            || o.OrderState == OrderState.TriggerPending; // HOTFIX-QX-DOUBLE-01
```

**PttBreakEven.cs — CancelStaleBracketsLocal**:
```diff
 bool stateOk = o.OrderState == OrderState.Working
-            || o.OrderState == OrderState.Initialized;
+            || o.OrderState == OrderState.Initialized
+            || o.OrderState == OrderState.Submitted         // HOTFIX-QX-DOUBLE-01
+            || o.OrderState == OrderState.Accepted          // HOTFIX-QX-DOUBLE-01
+            || o.OrderState == OrderState.TriggerPending;   // HOTFIX-QX-DOUBLE-01
```

### Pipeline work needed (block BXX-LaneA)
- Ph1 Architecture: document NT8 order state lifecycle for ATM brackets
- Ph3.5 Tickets: add tests:
  - T_QX_DOUBLE_01: `CancelQxBrackets` with TriggerPending order -> order IS in stale list
  - T_QX_DOUBLE_02: `CancelQxBrackets` with Submitted order -> order IS in stale list (regression)
  - T_QX_DOUBLE_03: `CancelQxBrackets` with Filled order -> order NOT in stale list (terminal state safe)
  - T_BE_CANCEL_01: `CancelStaleBracketsLocal` with TriggerPending -> order IS cancelled
  - T_BE_CANCEL_02: `CancelStaleBracketsLocal` with Accepted -> order IS cancelled
  - T_BE_CANCEL_03: `CancelStaleBracketsLocal` with PTT-BE-Stop -> order NOT cancelled (notBe guard)

## HOTFIX-BUG2-BE-RESET

**Date**: 2026-08-14 (live trading session)
**File**: `src/PropTraderTools/CopyEngine.cs`
**Method**: `OnOrderUpdate` (~line 692)
**Status**: APPLIED — awaiting pipeline
**Deferred item**: BUG-BE-RESET

### Bug
`TryFirePositionState(e)` was called PRE-Gate 2 — unconditionally for every account order.
When follower bracket orders (Stop1/Stop2/Target1/Target2 on Sim102) transitioned through
Filled/Cancelled states, `TryFirePositionState` fired for the follower account. If Sim102
had no open position at that moment, `hasPos=False` was fired, causing the panel's
`UpdateButtonColors` to reset `_beState` to Idle via HOTFIX-F3 — even when Sim101 (leader)
still had an open position.
Result: BE button armed by user → immediately disarmed by follower order state noise.

### Fix
Moved `TryFirePositionState(e)` from line 696 (pre-Gate 1) to after Gate 2.5 (post line 720).
Now fires ONLY when the order belongs to a matched leader account+instrument pair.
Follower orders never trigger `PositionStateChanged` events.

### JS-DNA compliance
- No `lock()` added ✅
- No `throw new` added ✅
- No `return null` added ✅
- CYC unchanged (no new branches) ✅

### Diff (minimal, CopyEngine.cs OnOrderUpdate)
```diff
-        // Pre-gate: fire position state unconditionally (even when copy disabled)
-        TryFirePositionState(e);
         // B62: evict dedup on terminal states...
         EvictDedup(...);
         // Gate 1 ... Gate 2 ... Gate 2.5 ...
+        // BUG-BE-RESET fix: fire position state ONLY for leader account+instrument orders
+        TryFirePositionState(e);
```

### Pipeline work needed
- Ph1: document that `TryFirePositionState` must be leader-scoped (after Gate 2.5)
- Ph3.5 Tickets: add test T_BE_RESET_01 — follower Filled event does NOT fire PositionStateChanged

---

## HOTFIX-DW-B64-01

**Date**: 2026-08-14 (live trading session)
**File**: `src/PropTraderTools/CopyEngine.cs`
**Method**: `OnOrderUpdate` Gate C (~line 766)
**Status**: APPLIED — awaiting pipeline
**Deferred item**: DW-B64-01

### Bug
Leader entry drag fires two NT8 `OnOrderUpdate` events for the same drag:
1. `OrderState.Accepted` — price updated — Gate C passes dedup check → `HandleEntryChange` called.
   `HandleEntryChange` calls `_dedupCache.TryRemove(orderId)` → key is now GONE.
2. `OrderState.Working` — same new price — Gate C `TryGetValue` misses (key gone) → falls through
   to `DispatchCopy` → a second PTT-Copy entry order is placed on the follower. DUPLICATE.

### Fix
Re-insert `currentPrice` into `_dedupCache` BEFORE calling `HandleEntryChange`.
`HandleEntryChange` then removes it (TryRemove), but on the second Working event, `TryGetValue`
finds the key with the new price → `Math.Abs(newPrice - newPrice) = 0 < tickSize` → skips.

### JS-DNA compliance
- No `lock()` added ✅ (`_dedupCache` is `ConcurrentDictionary`, indexer is thread-safe)
- No `throw new` added ✅
- No `return null` added ✅
- CYC unchanged ✅

### Diff (minimal)
```diff
 if (_dedupCache.TryGetValue(e.Order.OrderId.ToString(), out double storedPrice)
     && Math.Abs(currentPrice - storedPrice) >= tickSize)
 {
+    _dedupCache[e.Order.OrderId.ToString()] = currentPrice;  // DW-B64-01 fix
     HandleEntryChange(e.Order, matchedRule.Value);
     return;
 }
```

### Pipeline work needed
- Ph3.5 Tickets: add test T_DRAG_DEDUP_01 — second Working event after drag does NOT call DispatchCopy

---

## HOTFIX-DW-B72-02

**Date**: 2026-08-14 (live trading session)
**File**: `src/PropTraderTools/TradeCopierPanel.cs`
**Methods**: `OnGlobalBeClick`, `OnPendingBeFiredDispatch`, `UpdateButtonColors`
**Status**: APPLIED — awaiting pipeline
**Deferred item**: DW-B72-02

### Bug
`_globalBeState` (line 247) was a per-panel instance field. Two panels open (MES + MGC):
- Press BE ALL on MES → MES sets `_globalBeState = Armed` → MES button turns amber.
- MGC panel `_globalBeState` is still `Idle` → MGC button stays purple.
- They disagree. Also, if `OnPositionStateChanged` fired on one panel with `hasPos=False`,
  it reset `_beState` (per-chart) but never touched `_globalBeState` — stale state.

### Fix
Removed `_globalBeState` field entirely. All panels now read
`CopyEngine.Instance.IsPendingSlotsEmpty()` as the shared truth source:
- `OnGlobalBeClick`: `if (IsPendingSlotsEmpty()) → arm; else → disarm` (no local state)
- `OnPendingBeFiredDispatch`: `if (IsPendingSlotsEmpty()) → set Idle visual` (no check against local state)
- `UpdateButtonColors`: on flat, if slots not empty, DisarmPendingBe for all + set Idle visual

All panels call the same CopyEngine singleton, so both panels update consistently.

### JS-DNA compliance
- No `lock()` added ✅
- No `throw new` added ✅
- No `return null` added ✅
- CYC reduced (removed switch, replaced with if/else) ✅

### Pipeline work needed
- Ph1: document that BE ALL state must be singleton-scoped (CopyEngine), not panel-scoped
- Ph3.5 Tickets: add test T_BEALL_SYNC_01 — two panels, arm via one, verify both show Armed

## Pending items for pipeline runs

## HOTFIX-FIX-A-BE-BACKGROUND

**Date**: 2026-08-14 (live trading session)
**File**: `src/PropTraderTools/TradeCopierPanel.cs`
**Method**: `UpdateBeVisuals` (~line 1268)
**Status**: APPLIED — awaiting pipeline

### Bug
`UpdateBeVisuals(BeState.Idle)` only reset `Content` (label text) — never reset `Background`.
After user armed BE (BrushCaution amber set) then position closed (HOTFIX-F3 called Idle),
the button stayed amber forever with no label change, visually stuck in Armed state.

### Fix
Added `_beBtn2.Background = BrushInactive` to the `BeState.Idle` case.

---

## HOTFIX-FIX-B-TRYFIRE-CANCELLED

**Date**: 2026-08-14 (live trading session)
**File**: `src/PropTraderTools/CopyEngine.cs`
**Method**: `TryFirePositionState` (~line 1194)
**Status**: APPLIED — awaiting pipeline

### Bug
`TryFirePositionState` included `Cancelled` and `Rejected` in the trigger filter.
When a trade closes, NT8 cancels all ATM bracket orders (Stop1, Stop2, Target1, Target2).
Each cancel fires `TryFirePositionState` → `HasOpenPosition` = False (position already gone) →
`PositionStateChanged(hasPos=False)` → `UpdateButtonColors(false)` → HOTFIX-F3 resets
`_beState = Idle` → `UpdateBeVisuals(Idle)`. Hundreds of these per close = button never stays armed.

### Fix
Removed `Cancelled` and `Rejected` from filter. Only `Filled` and `PartFilled` fire now.
The flat state is still delivered correctly: the Filled close-order event fires hasPos=False
after position removal — one clean signal, not hundreds.

---

## HOTFIX-FIX-C-NO-DISARM-IN-UPDATEBUTTONCOLORS

**Date**: 2026-08-14 (live trading session)
**File**: `src/PropTraderTools/TradeCopierPanel.cs`
**Method**: `UpdateButtonColors` (~line 570)
**Status**: APPLIED — awaiting pipeline

### Bug
The DW-B72-02 block added in the previous session called `DisarmPendingBe` for ALL accounts
inside `UpdateButtonColors(hasPos=False)`. This fired on every ATM bracket cancel during close,
immediately destroying the pending BE slot the user had just armed. Result: BE arm button
pressed → slot created → ATM brackets cancel → DisarmPendingBe called → slot gone → price
never triggers → stop never moves.

### Fix
Removed the DW-B72-02 DisarmPendingBe block from UpdateButtonColors entirely.
BE ALL visual reset on flat is now handled only by `OnPendingBeFiredDispatch` (checks
`IsPendingSlotsEmpty()` after the trigger fires naturally). No forced disarm in UI event handlers.

**Status**: APPLIED — awaiting pipeline
**Deferred item**: BUG-BE-OCO-REUSE

### Bug
`BuildBeOcoId` used `accName.Substring(0, 4)` as the prefix component.
Both `"Sim101"` and `"Sim102"` produce prefix `"Sim1"`.
When `Execute()` iterates over both accounts with the same `seq` value, both calls produce
identical OCO IDs (e.g. `"PTT-BE-Sim1-00001-0"` for pair 0).
NT8 rejects the second `CreateOrder` call: `"The OCO ID 'PTT-BE-Sim1-00001-1' cannot be reused"`.
Result: all Sim102 BE bracket orders rejected — only Sim101 protected.

### Fix
Changed prefix to `accName.Substring(0, 8)` (or full name if shorter).
- `"Sim101"` → prefix `"Sim101"` → OCO ID `"PTT-BE-Sim101-00001-0"`
- `"Sim102"` → prefix `"Sim102"` → OCO ID `"PTT-BE-Sim102-00001-0"`
No collision possible between any two distinct account names.

## HOTFIX-BUG-BE-STOP-PRICE-SHORT

**Date**: 2026-08-15 (live trading session continuation)
**File**: `src/PropTraderTools/Features/PttBreakEven.cs`
**Method**: `ExecuteOneAccount` (~line 93)
**Status**: APPLIED — awaiting pipeline
**Deferred item**: BUG-BE-STOP-PRICE-SHORT

### Bug
`bePrice = pos.AveragePrice + (isLong ? +buf : -buf) * tickSize`

For a **short** position (e.g. entry at 7804.75, buf=1 tick):
- `bePrice = 7804.75 + (-1) * 0.25 = 7804.50`
- 7804.50 is **BELOW** entry price for a short
- A BuyToCover StopMarket at 7804.50 fires when price RISES to 7804.50
- But price is already at/below 7804.50 if the trade is profitable → stop fires immediately
- Also: a BuyToCover stop must be **ABOVE** the current bid to be accepted by NT8
  (stop at 7804.50 is below bid when trade is profitable → rejected)

For a **long** position (e.g. entry at 7804.75, buf=1 tick):
- `bePrice = 7804.75 + (+1) * 0.25 = 7805.00`
- 7805.00 is ABOVE entry price for a long
- A Sell StopMarket at 7805.00 fires when price DROPS to 7805.00
- That's above entry — captures 1 tick of profit, not true break-even
- (Minor issue — many traders prefer this convention, but it should match intent)

### Fix
Flipped sign for both directions:
`bePrice = pos.AveragePrice + (isLong ? -buf : +buf) * tickSize`

- Long:  `entry - buf*tick` → stop BELOW entry (fires if price drops back past entry)
- Short: `entry + buf*tick` → stop ABOVE entry (fires if price rises back to entry)

With buf=0: bePrice = avgPrice exactly (true break-even, no buffer).
With buf=1: long stop 1 tick below entry; short stop 1 tick above entry.

`IsBePriceOk` validation is still correct:
- Long (Sell stop):      `bePrice <= ask`  → entry - buf ≤ ask ✅
- Short (BuyToCover):    `bePrice >= bid`  → entry + buf ≥ bid ✅ (only true if not yet profitable)

### JS-DNA compliance
- No `lock()` added ✅
- No `throw new` added ✅
- No `return null` added ✅
- CYC unchanged (same ternary, sign change only) ✅

### Diff (minimal)
```diff

+            double bePrice = pos.AveragePrice + (isLong ? -buf : +buf) * tickSize;
```

### Pipeline work needed
- Ph1 Architecture: document buf sign convention (positive buf = away from profitable direction)
- Ph3.5 Tickets:
  - T_BE_PRICE_LONG_01: long at 100, buf=0 → bePrice=100 (exact entry)
  - T_BE_PRICE_LONG_02: long at 100, buf=1, tickSize=0.25 → bePrice=99.75 (below entry)
  - T_BE_PRICE_SHORT_01: short at 100, buf=0 → bePrice=100 (exact entry)
  - T_BE_PRICE_SHORT_02: short at 100, buf=1, tickSize=0.25 → bePrice=100.25 (above entry)
  - T_BE_PRICE_VALID_SHORT: short bePrice=100.25, bid=99.0 → IsBePriceOk returns true

## HOTFIX-BUG-BE-RAISE-NOTIFY-SIGN

**Date**: 2026-08-15 (live trading session continuation)
**File**: `src/PropTraderTools/Features/PttBreakEven.cs`
**Method**: `RaiseBeNotify` (~line 145)
**Status**: APPLIED — awaiting pipeline

### Bug
`RaiseBeNotify` had its own independent copy of the bePrice formula:
`leaderBePrice = leaderPos.AveragePrice + (leaderIsLong ? +buf : -buf) * tickSize`
This is the same wrong sign as HOTFIX-BUG-BE-STOP-SHORT — the value published to `PttBus.BeEventArgs`
was incorrect for short positions (and for long with buf>0).
This value is consumed by `OnPendingBeAccountUpdate` to display the BE price in the output log
and is potentially used by panel subscribers to cross-check the trigger price.

### Fix
Aligned sign with `ExecuteOneAccount`:
`leaderBePrice = leaderPos.AveragePrice + (leaderIsLong ? -buf : +buf) * tickSize`

### Diff (minimal)
```diff
-            double leaderBePrice = leaderPos.AveragePrice + (leaderIsLong ? +buf : -buf) * tickSize;

## HOTFIX-BUG-BE-INSTRUMENT-REF

**Date**: 2026-08-15 (live trading session continuation)
**File**: `src/PropTraderTools/CopyEngine.cs`
**Method**: `MoveStopToBreakEven` (~line 1885)
**Status**: APPLIED — awaiting pipeline
**Root cause of**: BE and BE ALL never moving the stop loss

### Bug
`MoveStopToBreakEven` filtered orders with reference equality:
```csharp
if (order.Instrument != instrument)  continue;
```
NT8 creates separate `Instrument` object instances per account context (confirmed by B69 DW-B69-02
which fixed the same pattern in `FindPosition` and `SubmitBeStop`). The reference equality check
always evaluates `true` (different objects = not equal), so **every single order in the loop was
skipped silently**. `acc.Change()` was never called. The stop never moved.

Confirmed by 12-12 PM CSV: every trade closes via `Name='Close'` (Chart Trader manual close).
Zero `PTT-BE-Stop` change events appear anywhere — not rejected, not errored, not called.
The pending trigger (`AccountItemUpdate`) fires correctly, `BreakEven()` is called, but
`MoveStopToBreakEven` exits the loop having done nothing.

This is why BE appeared to "work" early in the project (before B69 DW-B69-02 exposed
the same pattern) and then stopped working — or more precisely: it never worked for
accounts where the Instrument reference differed from the one stored in the copy rule.

### Fix
Changed reference equality to `FullName` string comparison — identical to the B69 fix:
```diff
-if (order.Instrument != instrument)
+if (order.Instrument == null || order.Instrument.FullName != instrument.FullName)
```

### JS-DNA compliance
- No `lock()` added ✅
- No `throw new` added ✅
- No `return null` added ✅
- CYC unchanged (same filter, extra null guard) ✅

### Pipeline work needed
- Ph3.5 Tickets: T_BE_MOVE_01 — MoveStopToBreakEven with different Instrument object instances but same FullName → Change() IS called

## HOTFIX-BUG-BE-MOVESTOP-SIGN

**Date**: 2026-08-15 (live trading session continuation)
**File**: `src/PropTraderTools/CopyEngine.cs`
**Method**: `MoveStopToBreakEven` (~line 1881)
**Status**: APPLIED — awaiting pipeline

### Bug
`MoveStopToBreakEven` had the same wrong sign as `PttBreakEven.ExecuteOneAccount`:
```csharp
double direction = isLong ? 1.0 : -1.0;
```
- Short position: `newStop = avgPrice - buf*tick` → stop placed BELOW entry for a short = wrong.

### Fix
Aligned with `PttBreakEven` fix (HOTFIX-BUG-BE-STOP-SHORT):
```diff
-double direction = isLong ? 1.0 : -1.0;
+double direction = isLong ? -1.0 : +1.0;
```
With buf=0 this has no practical effect (both produce `avgPrice`). Matters when buf > 0.

## HOTFIX-BUG-BE-IMMEDIATE

**Date**: 2026-08-15 (live trading session continuation)
**File**: `src/PropTraderTools/CopyEngine.cs`
**Method**: `ArmPendingBe` (~line 2075)
**Status**: APPLIED — awaiting pipeline

### Bug
`ArmPendingBe` always armed a pending watcher — no path existed to fire immediately
when price was already at or past the BE level at button-press time.

- Per-chart BE button (OnBeClick): had its own `IsPriceAlreadyAtBe` check at panel level,
  routing to `DispatchModule("BE")` for the immediate case. Only armed when in drawdown.
- BE ALL (OnGlobalBeClick → GlobalBe.Execute → ArmAllPendingBe → ArmPendingBe):
  no immediate-fire path existed at all. Always armed, always waited for AccountItemUpdate
  to fire. If price was already past entry when BE ALL was pressed, the trigger condition
  was immediately true on the first AccountItemUpdate tick — but that requires at least one
  account item event to fire after the button press, which may not happen quickly or at all
  in a slow market.

More critically: after HOTFIX-BUG-BE-INSTRUMENT-REF fixed MoveStopToBreakEven, the
pending path now actually works. But "in the green" = already profitable = the trigger
should fire the moment BE is pressed, not wait for the next PnL tick.

### Fix
Added immediate-fire check inside `ArmPendingBe` before writing to `_pendingBeSlots`:
- Reads current bid (long) or ask (short) from `instr.MarketData`
- Computes `target = avgPrice + (isLong ? +1.0 : -1.0) * buf * tick` (same formula as trigger)
- If `refPx` is already past `target` → call `BreakEven()` + `PendingBeFired` immediately, return
- If market data unavailable (refPx=0) → fall through to normal arm (safe fallback)

This fixes both per-chart BE and BE ALL for the "in the green" case via a single engine-level fix.

### JS-DNA compliance
- No `lock()` added ✅
- No `throw new` added ✅
- No `return null` added ✅
- CYC increase: 4→6 (added tickSize guard + alreadyAtBe branch) ✅ (still ≤8)

### Behavior after fix
| Scenario | Before | After |
|---|---|---|
| Press BE while in drawdown (red) | Arms watcher ✅ | Arms watcher ✅ |
| Press BE while at break-even | Arms watcher, waits forever | Fires immediately ✅ |
| Press BE while in profit (green) | Arms watcher, fires on next PnL tick | Fires immediately ✅ |
| No market data (refPx=0) | Arms watcher | Arms watcher (safe fallback) ✅ |

### Pipeline work needed
- Ph3.5 Tickets:
  - T_BE_IMM_01: ArmPendingBe long, bid >= target → BreakEven called immediately, no slot added
  - T_BE_IMM_02: ArmPendingBe short, ask <= target → BreakEven called immediately, no slot added
  - T_BE_IMM_03: ArmPendingBe, refPx=0 (no market data) → slot added normally (arms watcher)
  - T_BE_IMM_04: ArmPendingBe long, bid < target → slot added (arms watcher, does not fire)

## DIAG-MOVESTOP-01

**Date**: 2026-08-15 (live trading session — continue)
**File**: `src/PropTraderTools/CopyEngine.cs`
**Method**: `MoveStopToBreakEven` (~line 1872)
**Status**: APPLIED — diagnostic only, remove once BE confirmed working

### Purpose
`StatusUpdate` only writes to the panel's `_statusText` label — invisible in the NT8 Output tab.
`MoveStopToBreakEven` had zero visibility into which filter gate was skipping orders.
Added `NinjaTrader.Code.Output.Process("[MSTBE] ...")` at every skip point and at the
`acc.Change()` call site so the next BE test shows exactly why the stop is or isn't moving.

### What the output tells us
After pressing BE (armed, then price crosses to green):
- `[MSTBE] acc=Sim101 instr=... posQty=N` — confirms method is called
- `[MSTBE] SKIP flat` — position not found (FindPosition bug) or qty=0
- `[MSTBE] SKIP state: Stop1 state=Accepted` — orders not yet Working (timing issue)
- `[MSTBE] SKIP state: Stop1 state=TriggerPending` — ATM bracket not yet submitted
- `[MSTBE] SKIP type: Stop1 type=StopLimit` — (should NOT appear; StopLimit is allowed)
- `[MSTBE] SKIP not-stop-leg: SomeOrder` — order name doesn't start with "Stop"/"STP"
- `[MSTBE] SKIP already-at-be: Stop1 stopPx=X newStop=X` — idempotency guard firing
- `[MSTBE] CALLING Change() on Stop1 ...` — method reached acc.Change()
- `[MSTBE] Change() OK Stop1 @ X` — acc.Change() succeeded
- `[MSTBE] Change() EXCEPTION Stop1: ...` — acc.Change() threw

### Remove when
All four scenarios are confirmed working:
1. BE armed (in drawdown) → price crosses → stop moves (pending path)
2. BE pressed "in the green" → immediate fire → stop moves
3. BE ALL → both leader and follower stops move
4. No duplicate stops placed

### JS-DNA compliance
- No `lock()` added ✅
- No `throw new` added ✅
- No `return null` added ✅
- CYC unchanged (Output.Process calls are straight-line, no branching) ✅

## HOTFIX-MSTBE-STATE

**Date**: 2026-08-15 (live trading session)
**File**: `src/PropTraderTools/CopyEngine.cs`
**Method**: `MoveStopToBreakEven` (~line 1913)
**Status**: APPLIED — awaiting pipeline

### Bug (confirmed by DIAG-MOVESTOP-01 output)
Every `[MSTBE]` invocation showed:
```
[MSTBE] SKIP state: Stop1 state=Accepted
[MSTBE] SKIP state: Stop2 state=Accepted
```
Zero `Working` orders — `acc.Change()` was never called.

Root cause: NT8 sim ATM brackets go `TriggerPending → Accepted → Working` after the entry fills.
`OnPendingBeAccountUpdate` fires on the first PnL tick (AccountItemUpdate) which arrives while
Stop1/Stop2 are still in `Accepted` state — before they transition to `Working`.
The state filter `order.OrderState != OrderState.Working` blocked every order → stop never moved.

`acc.Change()` on `Accepted` orders is valid NT8 API (same as Chart Trader drag operation).
NT8_FULL_REFERENCE.md: `acc.Change()` accepts orders in `Accepted` state.

### Fix
Widened state filter from `Working` only to `Working || Accepted || TriggerPending`.

### JS-DNA compliance
- No `lock()` added ✅
- No `throw new` added ✅
- No `return null` added ✅
- CYC increase: 6 → 7 (one extra bool expression, still ≤ 8) ✅

### Diff (minimal)
```diff
-if (order.OrderState != OrderState.Working)
+bool stateOk = order.OrderState == OrderState.Working
+            || order.OrderState == OrderState.Accepted

+if (!stateOk)
```

### Pipeline work needed
- Ph3.5 Tickets:
  - T_BE_MOVE_03: MoveStopToBreakEven with Accepted stop → Change() IS called
  - T_BE_MOVE_04: MoveStopToBreakEven with TriggerPending stop → Change() IS called
  - T_BE_MOVE_05: MoveStopToBreakEven with Cancelled stop → Change() NOT called (still filtered)

## HOTFIX-FLAT-DISARM

**Date**: 2026-08-15 (live trading session)
**File**: `src/PropTraderTools/TradeCopierPanel.cs`
**Method**: `UpdateButtonColors` (~line 565)
**Status**: APPLIED — awaiting pipeline

### Bug
When the user manually closes a position while BE is Armed (yellow button), the button
stays yellow permanently. Two parts to the failure:
1. HOTFIX-F3 correctly resets `_beState = Idle` and calls `UpdateBeVisuals(Idle)` for the visual.
2. BUT it never called `DisarmPendingBe` — the engine slot stayed alive forever.
3. On the next trade, the stale slot would fire `BreakEven()` for the OLD instrument/account,
   potentially moving a stop that belongs to a different trade context.

FIX-C (prior session) removed ALL `DisarmPendingBe` calls from `UpdateButtonColors` because
the blanket disarm was killing slots during active trades (ATM bracket Cancelled events fired
`UpdateButtonColors(false)` mid-trade). That was correct — but left no disarm at all.

The corrected logic: disarm ONLY when `hasPosition=false` AND `_beState != Idle` (position
truly closed while armed). Post-HOTFIX-BUG2-BE-RESET, this path only fires for the leader
account (follower bracket noise is filtered by Gate 2.5 before `TryFirePositionState`), so
`hasPos=false` here reliably means the leader is flat.

### Fix
Inside the existing HOTFIX-F3 block (already gated by `!hasPosition && _beState != Idle`),
added:
1. `CopyEngine.Instance.DisarmPendingBe(_leaderAccount)` — clean up engine slot
2. `if (IsPendingSlotsEmpty()) UpdateBeAllVisuals(BeState.Idle)` — reset BE ALL button

### JS-DNA compliance
- No `lock()` added ✅
- No `throw new` added ✅
- No `return null` added ✅ (`_leaderAccount` null-guarded before call)
- CYC unchanged (added two straight-line calls inside existing branch) ✅

## HOTFIX-ENTRY-DRAG-DEDUP

**Date**: 2026-08-15 (live trading session)
**File**: `src/PropTraderTools/CopyEngine.cs`
**Method**: `HandleEntryChange` (~line 1140)
**Status**: APPLIED — awaiting pipeline

### Bug
`TryRemove(orderId)` removed the leader order key from `_dedupCache` immediately after
`HandleEntryChange` was called from Gate C. NT8 then fires a second `OnOrderUpdate` event
for the same leader order (Accepted → Working state transition). At that point Gate C's
`TryGetValue` returns false (key was removed), the drag-price delta check is never reached,
and the code falls through to `DispatchCopy`. A second `PTT-Copy` order is placed on the
follower → 2× contracts.

Note: HOTFIX-DW-B64-01 (same session) added `_dedupCache[orderId] = currentPrice` in Gate C
BEFORE calling `HandleEntryChange`, specifically to survive the `TryRemove`. But `HandleEntryChange`
then immediately removes the key again at line 1140, undoing that fix for the Working-state event.

### Fix
Replaced `_dedupCache.TryRemove(leaderOrder.OrderId.ToString(), out _)` with
`_dedupCache[leaderOrder.OrderId.ToString()] = newPrice` (upsert, not remove).

Keeping the key alive means the second Working-state event hits Gate C, finds the stored price,
computes `Math.Abs(newPrice - newPrice) = 0 < tickSize`, and exits without calling `DispatchCopy`.
`DispatchCopy`'s own `IsDedup` check also independently blocks it.

### JS-DNA compliance
- No `lock()` added ✅ (`_dedupCache` is `ConcurrentDictionary`, indexer write is lock-free)
- No `throw new` added ✅
- No `return null` added ✅
- CYC unchanged (one-for-one line replacement) ✅

### Diff (minimal)
```diff
-            // Update stored price in dedup cache to track latest leader price.
-            // B67-LaneB DW-B67-02: remove stale key after cancel+resubmit.
-            // New entry will be re-keyed by DispatchCopy on the follower's Accepted event.

+            _dedupCache[leaderOrder.OrderId.ToString()] = newPrice;
```

### Pipeline work needed
- Ph1 Architecture: document that `HandleEntryChange` must keep leader key alive (upsert semantics) after cancel+resubmit
- Ph3.5 Tickets:
  - T_DRAG_DEDUP_02: Working-state re-entry after drag — Gate C sees delta=0 → DispatchCopy NOT called
  - T_DRAG_DEDUP_03: After HandleEntryChange completes — orderId key still present in _dedupCache at newPrice
  - T_DRAG_DEDUP_04: New follower order (cancel+resubmit path) — new orderId keyed correctly via line 1180

## HOTFIX-MSTBE-CANCEL-RESUBMIT

**Date**: 2026-08-14 (live trading session)
**ID**: HOTFIX-MSTBE-CANCEL-RESUBMIT
**File**: `src/PropTraderTools/CopyEngine.cs`
**Method**: `MoveStopToBreakEven(Account acc, Instrument instrument, int bufferTicks)`
**Status**: APPLIED — awaiting pipeline

### Bug

`acc.Change()` is a silent no-op when called on ATM-bracket-owned orders (`Stop1`, `Stop2`)
from AddOn context. The NT8 ATM engine owns those brackets and ignores `acc.Change()` calls —
no exception is raised and no effect occurs on the stop price.

**Confirmed in NT8 output log**: `[MSTBE] Change() OK Stop1 @ <newPrice>` was logged while
the stop remained at its original price in the Orders tab.

### Fix

Replaced the entire `foreach (var order in acc.Orders.ToList())` loop and its `acc.Change()`
body with a cancel+resubmit pattern mirroring `PttBreakEven.ExecuteOneAccount`:

- **Step A** — Snapshot target orders (Working/Accepted Limit orders matching `Target1..Target9`)
  before cancelling anything. Mirrors `PttBreakEven.SnapshotTargetsLocal`.
- **Step B** — Cancel all stale brackets: Working | Initialized | Submitted | Accepted |
  TriggerPending orders on the instrument that do not already start with `PTT-BE-`.
  Mirrors `PttBreakEven.CancelStaleBracketsLocal`. Cancel errors are non-fatal (caught).
- **Step C** — Submit new `PTT-BE-Stop-N` + `PTT-BE-Target-N` OCO pairs (or one bare
  `PTT-BE-Stop` when no targets found). Mirrors `PttBreakEven.SubmitBeTargetsLocal`.
  All `CreateOrder` calls use NT8-049 arg order (StopMarket: arg6=0, arg7=stop;
  Limit: arg6=price, arg7=0), NT8-007 cast, NT8-013 DateTime.MaxValue, NT8-014 PTT- prefix.

Guards preserved unchanged: all guards before the loop (`IsFlat`, tickSize, newStop calc,
DIAG-MOVESTOP-01 log lines 1878-1903, `isLong`, `newStop`).

`BreakEven()`, `ArmPendingBe()`, `OnPendingBeAccountUpdate()` are not touched.

## HOTFIX-MSTBE-OCO-REUSE

- **ID**: HOTFIX-MSTBE-OCO-REUSE
- **File**: src/PropTraderTools/CopyEngine.cs
- **Method**: MoveStopToBreakEven + field _mstbeOcoSeq
- **Bug**: Static OCO ID PTT-BE-Sim101-0 reused on second BE press -- NT8 rejects all orders, position unprotected
- **Fix**: volatile int _mstbeOcoSeq + Interlocked.Increment per call, mirrors PttBreakEven._beOcoSeq (DW-B40-OCO-02)
- **Status**: APPLIED -- awaiting pipeline

## HOTFIX-MSTBE-OCO-REUSE

**Date**: 2026-08-15 (live trading session)
**File**: `src/PropTraderTools/CopyEngine.cs`
**Methods**: `MoveStopToBreakEven` (OCO ID generation) + field declaration
**Status**: APPLIED + SYNCED — awaiting live test
**Deferred item**: HOTFIX-MSTBE-OCO-REUSE

### Bug
`MoveStopToBreakEven` OCO ID formula was:
```csharp
string ocoId_i = "PTT-BE-" + acc.Name.Substring(0, Math.Min(8, acc.Name.Length)) + "-" + i;
```
This is **static per session** — `i` is the pair index (0, 1), not a monotonic counter.
On a second BE press after the first set of `PTT-BE-*` orders are cancelled/filled, NT8 refuses
to reuse a cancelled OCO ID within the same session:
`"The OCO ID 'PTT-BE-Sim101-0' cannot be reused."`
All 4 PTT-BE orders on the second press are rejected → position left unprotected after second press.

Root cause is identical to `PttBreakEven._beOcoSeq` (DW-B40-OCO-02) which already fixes this
pattern for the `PttBreakEven.SubmitBeTargetsLocal` path.

### Fix
Added field (line 156):
```csharp
// HOTFIX-MSTBE-OCO-REUSE: monotonic counter for BE OCO IDs -- never reuse a cancelled OCO ID.
// DW-B40-OCO-02 pattern from PttBreakEven._beOcoSeq. JS-023: volatile int allowed.
private volatile int _mstbeOcoSeq = 0;
```

Added `seq` increment before the OCO submission loop (line 2015):
```csharp
int seq = System.Threading.Interlocked.Increment(ref _mstbeOcoSeq);
```

Changed OCO ID generation inside the loop:
```diff
-string ocoId_i = "PTT-BE-"
-    + acc.Name.Substring(0, Math.Min(8, acc.Name.Length))
-    + "-" + i;
+string ocoId_i = "PTT-BE-"
+    + acc.Name.Substring(0, Math.Min(8, acc.Name.Length))
+    + "-" + seq.ToString("D5") + "-" + i;
```

Result: First press → `PTT-BE-Sim101-00001-0`, `PTT-BE-Sim101-00001-1`.
Second press → `PTT-BE-Sim101-00002-0`, `PTT-BE-Sim101-00002-1`. No collision.

### Expected test output (NT8 Output Tab 1)
- First BE press: `ocoId=PTT-BE-Sim101-00001-0`, `ocoId=PTT-BE-Sim101-00001-1`
- Second BE press: `ocoId=PTT-BE-Sim101-00002-0`, `ocoId=PTT-BE-Sim101-00002-1`
- All 4 orders appear in Orders tab on both presses

### Failure signature (old bug)
Second press shows `ocoId=PTT-BE-Sim101-0` and orders silently fail → position unprotected.

### JS-DNA compliance
- No `lock()` added ✅ (`Interlocked.Increment` is lock-free, JS-023)
- No `throw new` added ✅
- No `return null` added ✅

## HOTFIX-FLAT-DISARM-FOLLOWER

**Date**: 2026-08-15 (live trading session)
**File**: `src/PropTraderTools/CopyEngine.cs`
**Method**: `OnOrderUpdate` (pre-Gate 1 section, ~line 700)
**Status**: APPLIED + SYNCED — awaiting live test
**Fixes**: HOTFIX-FLAT-DISARM partial failure — BE button stayed yellow after manual close

### Bug
HOTFIX-FLAT-DISARM (prior session) correctly resets `_beState=Idle` and calls
`DisarmPendingBe(_leaderAccount)` when `UpdateButtonColors(hasPos=false)` fires.

But `UpdateButtonColors(false)` was **never called** after the follower's PTT-BE stop filled:
- When `PTT-BE-Stop-1/2` fills on **Sim102 (follower)**, `OnOrderUpdate` fires for Sim102.
- Gate 2 checks `e.Order.Account.Name == rule.MasterAccount?.Name`.
- Sim102 is a follower account, not a master — Gate 2 returns null → early exit at line 717.
- `TryFirePositionState` is never reached → `PositionStateChanged` never fires.
- Panel's `OnPositionStateChanged` never called → `UpdateButtonColors(false)` never called.
- HOTFIX-F3 / HOTFIX-FLAT-DISARM never execute → BE button stays yellow permanently.

The leader (Sim101) closes via `Name='Close'` first. `TryFirePositionState` fires for Sim101,
`HasOpenPosition(Sim101)=false`, panel resets correctly. But when the user then places a new
trade on Sim102 and presses BE, then the PTT-BE stop fills and closes Sim102 — the button
stays yellow because Sim102 is never the subject of a `PositionStateChanged` event.

### Fix
Added a narrow pre-Gate-1 path in `OnOrderUpdate`:
- Triggers only on: `Filled` + `Name.StartsWith("PTT-BE-Stop")` + non-leader account
- Non-leader check: iterate `_rules`, confirm account is not any rule's `MasterAccount`
- If non-leader: fire `PositionStateChanged` directly with current `HasOpenPosition` result

This is safe because:
1. Leader PTT-BE-Stop fills still go through `TryFirePositionState` via the normal path (Gate 2 passes for leaders)
2. The non-leader check prevents double-firing for any edge case where leader account name matches
3. `PTT-BE-Stop*` prefix is unique to this codepath (not used by QX or any other feature)
4. `HasOpenPosition` is lock-free (ConcurrentDictionary read via `FindPosition`)

### JS-DNA compliance
- No `lock()` added ✅ (`_rules` is read-only after init; `HasOpenPosition` is lock-free)
- No `throw new` added ✅
- No `return null` added ✅
- CYC increase: +2 (outer `if` + inner `foreach` loop) — total method stays ≤ 8 ✅

### Diff (minimal, OnOrderUpdate pre-Gate-1)
```diff

+            }
+        }
         // Gate 1: enabled check
         if (!_isCopyEnabled)
```

### Expected behavior after fix
- BE armed (yellow) → PTT-BE stops fire on Sim102 → Sim102 goes flat → `PositionStateChanged`
  fires with `hasPos=false` → `UpdateButtonColors(false)` → HOTFIX-F3 → `_beState=Idle` →
  button goes grey → `DisarmPendingBe` clears any residual slot → button stays grey ✅

### Pipeline work needed
- Ph3.5 Tickets:
  - T_FOLLOWER_FLAT_01: PTT-BE-Stop-1 fills on follower → PositionStateChanged fired with hasPos=false
  - T_FOLLOWER_FLAT_02: PTT-BE-Stop-1 fills on leader → NOT fired by this path (isLeader=true guard)
  - T_FOLLOWER_FLAT_03: PTT-QX-Stop fills on follower → NOT fired (name does not start with "PTT-BE-Stop")
  - T_FOLLOWER_FLAT_04: PTT-BE-Stop fills on follower but position still open (partial fill) → hasPos=true fired correctly

  `_quickAllT1` was correctly removed as a field by HOTFIX-QUICKALL-SINGLETON-01 but the button
  init line `Content = FormatBuffer("Quick ALL", _quickAllT1)` was not updated.

**Bug**: CS0070 — `PttGlobalBreakEven.IncrementBuffer/DecrementBuffer` called
  `CopyEngine.Instance.GlobalBeBufferChanged?.Invoke(...)` from outside `CopyEngine`.
  C# CS0070 rule: an `event` field may only be raised (Invoke) from inside the declaring class.
  The `GlobalQuickAllBufferChanged` event had the same raise moved inside `CopyEngine.IncrementQuickAll/DecrementQuickAll`
  (where it is legal), but `GlobalBeBufferChanged` was raised externally from `PttGlobalBreakEven`.
**Fix**: Added one-line relay method `internal void RaiseBeBufferChanged(int newValue) => GlobalBeBufferChanged?.Invoke(newValue);`
  inside `CopyEngine`. `PttGlobalBreakEven.IncrementBuffer/DecrementBuffer` now call
  `CopyEngine.Instance.RaiseBeBufferChanged(...)` instead of direct `?.Invoke`.

## HOTFIX-THREAD-DISPATCH-01

**ID**: HOTFIX-THREAD-DISPATCH-01
**File**: `src/PropTraderTools/TradeCopierPanel.cs`
**Methods**: `OnGlobalBeBufferChanged` + `OnQuickAllBufferChanged`
**Bug**: Both handlers set WPF control `.Content` directly on the calling panel's UI thread.
  In NT8, each Chart window has its own Dispatcher. Panel A's spin button fires the event
  synchronously on Panel A's thread; Panel B's handler runs on Panel A's thread but Panel B's
  WPF controls belong to Panel B's Dispatcher → InvalidOperationException: "The calling thread
  cannot access this object because a different thread owns it."
**Fix**: Wrapped both handlers in `Dispatcher.InvokeAsync` (same pattern as `OnPendingBeFiredDispatch`
  and `OnPendingBeArmedDispatch`).
**Status**: APPLIED — awaiting pipeline

## HOTFIX-BEALL-DISARM-SYNC-01

**ID**: HOTFIX-BEALL-DISARM-SYNC-01

**Methods**: `GlobalBeAllDisarmed` event + `RaiseBeAllDisarmed()` relay + `OnGlobalBeAllDisarmed` handler
  + `OnGlobalBeClick` disarm path + `UpdateButtonColors` HOTFIX-F3 branch
**Bug 1**: Clicking BE ALL to disarm called `UpdateBeAllVisuals(Idle)` only on the clicked panel.
  No event was broadcast — other panels stayed yellow.
**Bug 2**: When position closes while BE is armed, `UpdateButtonColors(false)` only fires on the
  panel whose instrument matches the closed position. Other panels (e.g. MGC panel watching a MES
  position) never receive the flat signal → button stays yellow permanently.
**Fix**: Added `internal event Action GlobalBeAllDisarmed` + `internal void RaiseBeAllDisarmed()`
  relay on CopyEngine. All panels subscribe/unsubscribe in OnLoaded/Detach. Handler calls
  `Dispatcher.InvokeAsync(() => UpdateBeAllVisuals(Idle))`. `RaiseBeAllDisarmed()` is called
  from (1) `OnGlobalBeClick` disarm path after `UpdateBeAllVisuals(Idle)`, and (2) `UpdateButtonColors`

**Bug**: `PttBreakEven._beOcoSeq` (per-instance, per-chart BE path) and `CopyEngine._mstbeOcoSeq`
  (BE ALL / MoveStopToBreakEven path) are separate counters both starting at 0. First BE ALL press
  → `_mstbeOcoSeq` = 1 → creates `PTT-BE-Sim101-00001-0`. Subsequent per-chart BE press →
  `_beOcoSeq` on new PttBreakEven instance = 1 → same OCO ID `PTT-BE-Sim101-00001-0` → NT8 rejects:
  "OCO ID cannot be reused."
**Fix**: Added `internal int NextBeOcoSeq() => Interlocked.Increment(ref _mstbeOcoSeq)` on
  CopyEngine. Removed `_beOcoSeq` field from PttBreakEven. `PttBreakEven.Execute` now calls
  `CopyEngine.Instance?.NextBeOcoSeq() ?? 1` — both paths share the same global counter.

**ID**: HOTFIX-FOLLOWER-LABEL-CLIP-01
**File**: `src/PropTraderTools/TradeCopierPanel.cs`
**Method**: `BuildInlineFollowerRow` (~line 1721)
**Bug**: Account name `TextBlock` had `Width = 90` (fixed pixels). Long PA/Apex account names like
  `PA-APEX-422136-01U` (~20 chars, ~160px needed) were clipped — last digits invisible. User could
  not distinguish which follower accounts were selected, masking a potential double-selection bug.
**Fix**: Replaced `StackPanel` row with `DockPanel` (`LastChildFill = true`). ATM combo and PnL
  label are `DockPanel.SetDock(Dock.Right)`. Name label has no fixed `Width` and fills remaining
  space as the `LastChildFill` child. `TextTrimming = CharacterEllipsis` for graceful degradation
  on very narrow panels.

## HOTFIX-DISPATCH-FIX-01

**Date**: 2026-08-16 (live trading session)
**Files**: `src/PropTraderTools/CopyEngine.cs`, `src/PropTraderTools/TradeCopierPanel.cs`
**Methods**: `RaiseBeBufferChanged`, `IncrementQuickAll`, `DecrementQuickAll`, `OnGlobalBeBufferChanged`, `OnQuickAllBufferChanged`
**Status**: APPLIED + SYNCED — awaiting live test

### Bug
`GlobalBeBufferChanged` and `GlobalQuickAllBufferChanged` events were raised synchronously
(`.Invoke()`) from Panel A's RepeatButton click handler on Panel A's chart Dispatcher thread.
NT8 creates a separate Dispatcher per chart window (`chart.Dispatcher.InvokeAsync` pattern at
TradeCopierAddOn.cs:168). Panel B's handler ran on Panel A's thread. The inner
`this.Dispatcher.InvokeAsync(lambda)` posted to Panel B's Dispatcher, but the lambda could
reach Panel B's WPF controls from the wrong thread → `InvalidOperationException:
"The calling thread cannot access this object because a different thread owns it."`

### Fix
Changed raise sites in CopyEngine to use `System.Windows.Application.Current.Dispatcher.InvokeAsync`.
All NT8 UI runs on the Application.Current Dispatcher. Events now arrive at subscribers on
the correct thread. Removed redundant inner `Dispatcher.InvokeAsync` wrappers from the two
TradeCopierPanel buffer handlers (`OnGlobalBeBufferChanged`, `OnQuickAllBufferChanged`).

This matches the existing `TradeCopierAddOn.cs:252` pattern: `System.Windows.Application.Current.Dispatcher.InvokeAsync(...)`.

## HOTFIX-MARKET-DEDUP-01

**Date**: 2026-08-16 (live trading session)
**File**: `src/PropTraderTools/CopyEngine.cs`
**Methods**: `IsDispatchTriggerState` (signature + body), `DispatchCopy` (call site line ~960)
**Status**: APPLIED + SYNCED — awaiting live test

### Bug
NT8/Rithmic changes `Order.OrderId` from GUID format (at `Submitted` state) to a permanent
numeric format (at `Accepted` state). `IsDispatchTriggerState` returned `true` for both states,
so `DispatchCopy` was called twice per Market order:
- Submitted: `IsDedup("25e44acc...", 0)` → cache miss → PTT-Copy #1 dispatched
- Accepted:  `IsDedup("2862949760", 0)` → DIFFERENT key → cache miss → PTT-Copy #2 dispatched

Confirmed by 08-37 PM log: orders 2862949761 and 2862949762 both named `PTT-Copy` both filled
on PA-APEX-422136-08, producing 14L when 7 was intended. Same doubling seen for PA-APEX-422136-01
and Sim102 in earlier log entries.

### Fix
Changed `IsDispatchTriggerState(OrderState)` to `IsDispatchTriggerState(OrderState, OrderType)`.
- Market orders: dispatch on `Submitted` only (GUID is stable; numeric ID arrives at Accepted).
- Limit orders: dispatch on `Accepted` only (AddOn path — `Submitted` never fires for these).
Updated single call site in `DispatchCopy` to pass `order.OrderType`.

### JS-DNA compliance
- No `lock()` added ✅
- No `throw new` added ✅
- No `return null` added ✅

## HOTFIX-BEALL-DISARM-CROSS-01

**File**: `src/PropTraderTools/TradeCopierPanel.cs`
**Method**: `UpdateButtonColors` (~line 569)
**Status**: APPLIED — awaiting pipeline
**Fixes**: BUG 2 partial — BE ALL stays yellow on second panel after manual close

### Bug
`RaiseBeAllDisarmed()` was inside `if (IsPendingSlotsEmpty())` guard. After
`DisarmPendingBe(_leaderAccount)` cleared this panel's slot, another panel's slot
could still exist → `IsPendingSlotsEmpty()` returns false → `RaiseBeAllDisarmed`
never fires → second panel stays amber.

### Fix
Moved `RaiseBeAllDisarmed()` and `UpdateBeAllVisuals(BeState.Idle)` OUTSIDE the
`IsPendingSlotsEmpty` guard. Both fire unconditionally when flat+armed. Each receiving
panel handles its own visual update in `OnGlobalBeAllDisarmed`.

### JS-DNA compliance

**Status**: APPLIED — awaiting pipeline
**Fixes**: BUF-LABEL-01 (button label not updating on spin), QUICK-LABEL-UNIT-01 (no "t" unit suffix)

### Bug
`OnGlobalBeBufferChanged` and `OnQuickAllBufferChanged` wrote to button Content directly on
Application.Current.Dispatcher. NT8 chart panel WPF elements were created on the chart-window
Dispatcher (different thread context). Writing from the wrong dispatcher = silent no-op.
Also: Quick ALL label showed "+4" with no unit — ambiguous across MES/MGC/MCL.

### Fix
Both handlers wrapped in `Dispatcher.InvokeAsync` (panel-local Dispatcher), mirroring
the correct pattern at `OnGlobalBeAllDisarmed` (line 907).
`FormatQuickAllBuffer` added to append "t" suffix: "Quick ALL +4t".

             new `PttGlobalQuickExit.SnapshotTargetOrders`, `PttQuickExit.Execute` (N-bracket rewrite)
**Status**: APPLIED — awaiting pipeline
**Fixes**: QUICK-T3-01 (only 2 brackets submitted regardless of ATM target count)

### Bug
`PttGlobalQuickExit.ResolveQuickTicks` always returned (T1, T2) — exactly 2 values.
`PttQuickExit.Execute` submitted exactly PTT-QX-Stop + PTT-QX-T1 (pair A) and
PTT-QX-Stop2 + PTT-QX-T2 (pair B). With a 3-target ATM ("MES $200 SL6"), Target3
and Stop3 survived uncancelled → dangling third bracket → position exposure.

### Fix
`SnapshotTargetOrders` added to `PttGlobalQuickExit` — scans acc.Orders for active
Limit target orders (ATM Target1..N, PTT-QX-T*, PTT-BE-Target-*) before cancelling anything.
`Execute` passes snapshot to `ExecuteOne` → `PttQuickExit.Execute`.
`PttQuickExit.Execute` rewrites bracket submission as a for-loop:
- targetCount = snapshot count, fallback 2 if none
- tNPrice = entry +/- t1Ticks*N * tick (proportional spacing)
- tNQty from snapshot[i].Qty, fallback evenly split
- each pair gets its own OCO ID (independent fills)
- stop names: PTT-QX-Stop, PTT-QX-Stop2, PTT-QX-Stop3 ...
- target names: PTT-QX-T1, PTT-QX-T2, PTT-QX-T3 ...

Also added `Execute(Account, Instrument, int t1, int t2, bool)` compat overload in
`PttQuickExit` to preserve `TradeCopierPanel.OnQuickClick` (off-limits per spec). The
compat overload passes an empty targets list → falls back to 2-target behavior.

### JS-DNA compliance
- No `lock()` added ✅
- No `throw new` added ✅
- No `return null` added ✅
- CYC: PttGlobalQuickExit.Execute stays 8, PttQuickExit.Execute = 8, SnapshotTargetOrders = 4 ✅

### Pipeline work needed
- Ph3.5 Tickets: T_QX_T3_01 — Execute with 3-target snapshot → 3 OCO pairs submitted
- Ph3.5 Tickets: T_QX_T3_02 — Execute with empty snapshot → 2 pairs (fallback)
- Ph3.5 Tickets: T_QX_T3_03 — tNPrice for i=2 (T3) = entry + t1*3*tick (proportional)
- Ph3.5 Tickets: T_QX_T3_04 — SnapshotTargetOrders finds ATM Target3 (ATM name match)
- Ph3.5 Tickets: T_QX_T3_05 — SnapshotTargetOrders finds PTT-QX-T3 (QX name match)

**Methods**: `IsAtmBracketName` (CopyEngine.cs ~line 469), `CancelStaleBracketsLocal` (PttBreakEven.cs ~line 185)
**Status**: APPLIED — awaiting pipeline
**Fixes**: T3-ORPHAN-01 (Stop3/Target3 not cancelled), OCO-REUSE-02 (root cause addressed)

### Bug
`IsAtmBracketName` was hardcoded to exactly 4 names: `Stop1`, `Stop2`, `Target1`, `Target2`.
Stop3..Stop9 and Target3..Target9 were NOT returned as cancel candidates by `IsQxCancelCandidate`,
so they survived uncancelled when Quick ALL or BE ALL ran against a 3-target ATM strategy.
`CancelStaleBracketsLocal` `notBe` filter used exact-match `o.Name != "PTT-BE-Stop"` — did not
exclude "PTT-BE-Stop-1", "PTT-BE-Stop-2" etc. from prior BE presses.

### Fix
`IsAtmBracketName`: replaced hardcoded 4-name check with generic:
- `name.StartsWith("Stop", Ordinal) && name.Length > 4 && char.IsDigit(name[4])`
- `name.StartsWith("Target", Ordinal) && name.Length > 6 && char.IsDigit(name[6])`
Matches Stop1..Stop9 and Target1..Target9 without enumerating each.
`CancelStaleBracketsLocal` `notBe`: changed to `!o.Name.StartsWith("PTT-BE-", Ordinal)`.

### JS-DNA compliance

## HOTFIX-BUFLABEL-02

**Date**: 2026-08-16 (live trading session)
**File**: `src/PropTraderTools/TradeCopierPanel.cs`
**Methods**: `OnGlobalBeBufferChanged`, `OnQuickAllBufferChanged`, new `FormatQuickAllBuffer`
**Status**: APPLIED — awaiting pipeline
**Fixes**: BUF-LABEL-01 (button label not updating on spin), QUICK-LABEL-UNIT-01 (no "t" unit suffix)

### Bug
`OnGlobalBeBufferChanged` and `OnQuickAllBufferChanged` wrote to button Content directly on
`Application.Current.Dispatcher`. NT8 chart panel WPF elements (`_globalBeBtn2`, `_quickAllBtn`)
were created on the chart-window Dispatcher — a different thread context from the app Dispatcher.
Writing to a WPF element from the wrong Dispatcher = silent no-op or cross-thread violation.
Also: Quick ALL label showed "+4" with no tick unit — ambiguous when trading MES/MGC/MCL.

### Fix
Both handlers wrapped in `Dispatcher.InvokeAsync` (panel-local Dispatcher), mirroring the
correct pattern at `OnGlobalBeAllDisarmed` (line 907).
New `FormatQuickAllBuffer` added to append "t" suffix: "Quick ALL +4t".
`FormatBuffer` (per-chart Quick button) is unchanged — no "t" suffix there.

## HOTFIX-BEALL-DISARM-CROSS-01

**Date**: 2026-08-16 (live trading session)
**File**: `src/PropTraderTools/TradeCopierPanel.cs`
**Method**: `UpdateButtonColors` (~line 569)
**Status**: APPLIED — awaiting pipeline
**Fixes**: BUG 2 — BE ALL stays yellow on second panel after manual close

### Bug
`RaiseBeAllDisarmed()` was inside `if (IsPendingSlotsEmpty())` guard. After
`DisarmPendingBe(_leaderAccount)` cleared this panel's slot, another panel's slot could still
exist → `IsPendingSlotsEmpty()` returns false → `RaiseBeAllDisarmed` never fires → second panel
stays amber permanently.

### Fix
Moved `RaiseBeAllDisarmed()` and `UpdateBeAllVisuals(BeState.Idle)` OUTSIDE the
`IsPendingSlotsEmpty` guard. Both fire unconditionally when flat+armed. Each receiving panel
handles its own visual update in `OnGlobalBeAllDisarmed`.

### JS-DNA compliance
- No `lock()` added ✅
- No `throw new` added ✅
- No `return null` added ✅
- CYC decreased (removed nested if) ✅

### Pipeline work needed

## HOTFIX-QUICK-T3-01

**Date**: 2026-08-16 (live trading session)
**Files**: `src/PropTraderTools/Features/PttGlobalQuickExit.cs`, `src/PropTraderTools/Features/PttQuickExit.cs`
**Methods**: `PttGlobalQuickExit.Execute`, `PttGlobalQuickExit.ExecuteOne` (signature change),
             new `PttGlobalQuickExit.SnapshotTargetOrders`, `PttQuickExit.Execute` (N-bracket rewrite)
**Status**: APPLIED — awaiting pipeline
**Fixes**: QUICK-T3-01 (only 2 brackets submitted regardless of ATM target count)

### Bug
`PttGlobalQuickExit.ResolveQuickTicks` always returned (T1, T2) — exactly 2 values.
`PttQuickExit.Execute` submitted exactly 2 OCO pairs (PTT-QX-Stop+T1 and PTT-QX-Stop2+T2).
With a 3-target ATM ("MES $200 SL6"), Target3 and Stop3 survived uncancelled → dangling bracket.

### Fix
`SnapshotTargetOrders` added to `PttGlobalQuickExit` — scans acc.Orders for active Limit target
orders (ATM Target1..N, PTT-QX-T*, PTT-BE-Target-*) before cancelling anything.
`Execute` passes snapshot to `ExecuteOne` → `PttQuickExit.Execute`.
`PttQuickExit.Execute` rewrites bracket submission as a for-loop (N pairs):
- targetCount = snapshot count, fallback 2 if none
- tNPrice = entry ±  t1Ticks*N * tick (proportional spacing)
- tNQty from snapshot[i].Qty, fallback evenly split
- each pair gets its own OCO ID (independent fills)
- stop names: PTT-QX-Stop, PTT-QX-Stop2, PTT-QX-Stop3 ...
- target names: PTT-QX-T1, PTT-QX-T2, PTT-QX-T3 ...
Backward-compat overload (t2Ticks param) preserved for single-chart Quick button callers.

### JS-DNA compliance
- No `lock()` added ✅

## HOTFIX-BEALL-FLAT-RESET

**Date**: 2026-08-16 (live trading session)
**File**: `src/PropTraderTools/TradeCopierPanel.cs`
**Method**: `UpdateButtonColors` (~line 569)
**Status**: APPLIED — awaiting pipeline
**Fixes**: BE ALL stays yellow after manual close when per-chart BE was not armed

### Bug
`HOTFIX-F3` gate: `!hasPosition && _beState != BeState.Idle`.
`_beState` is the **per-chart** BE button state only. When user presses BE ALL (global)
without pressing the per-chart BE button, `_beState` remains `BeState.Idle`. Gate evaluates
false → `UpdateBeAllVisuals(BeState.Idle)` and `RaiseBeAllDisarmed()` never execute →
BE ALL button stays amber after position closes via manual flatten.

### Fix
Extracted the BE ALL reset into a SEPARATE independent check:
```csharp
if (!hasPosition && !CopyEngine.Instance.IsPendingSlotsEmpty())
{
    if (_leaderAccount != null)
        CopyEngine.Instance.DisarmPendingBe(_leaderAccount);
    UpdateBeAllVisuals(BeState.Idle);
    CopyEngine.Instance.RaiseBeAllDisarmed();
}
```
This fires unconditionally whenever the position closes AND the engine still has a pending
BE slot — regardless of whether the per-chart BE button was ever armed.
Safe: `UpdateButtonColors(hasPos=false)` only arrives via `TryFirePositionState`
(Filled/PartFilled, post-Gate-2.5) — not on ATM bracket cancel noise.
Double-fire with HOTFIX-F3 is safe: if F3 block runs `DisarmPendingBe` first, then
`IsPendingSlotsEmpty()` returns true and the new block skips.

### JS-DNA compliance
- No `lock()` added ✅
- No `throw new` added ✅
- No `return null` added ✅
- CYC: +1 (new independent if block, still well below 8) ✅

### Pipeline work needed
- Ph3.5 Tickets: T_BEALL_FLAT_01 — position closes with BE ALL armed, per-chart BE NOT armed → BE ALL resets to Idle
- Ph3.5 Tickets: T_BEALL_FLAT_02 — position closes with BOTH armed → both reset, no double-fire

## HOTFIX-SNAPSHOT-STOP-INSTRREF

**Date**: 2026-08-17 (live trading session)
**File**: `src/PropTraderTools/Features/PttQuickExit.cs`
**Method**: `SnapshotStopPrice` (~line 179)
**Status**: APPLIED -- awaiting pipeline

### Bug
`SnapshotStopPrice` used reference equality `o.Instrument != instr` to filter orders by
instrument. NT8 creates separate `Instrument` object instances per account context -- two
objects representing the same instrument are NOT reference-equal. This means every order
in the loop was skipped (the condition was always true), so `snapshotStop` was always 0.0.

With `snapshotStop == 0`, the guard `if (snapshotStop > 0)` at `PttQuickExit.Execute` line 100
skips ALL stop submissions. Quick ALL produces target orders only (PTT-QX-T1/T2/T3) with
NO matching stop orders -- position has no downside protection after a Quick ALL press.

Root cause is identical to HOTFIX-BUG-BE-INSTRUMENT-REF (CopyEngine.cs MoveStopToBreakEven,
same session) and the B69 DW-B69-02 fix in FindPosition/SubmitBeStop.

### Fix
Changed reference equality to `FullName` string comparison, identical to the pattern used
in `CancelQxBrackets` (CopyEngine.cs line 513):
```diff
-                if (o.Instrument != instr) continue;
+                if (o.Instrument == null || o.Instrument.FullName != instr?.FullName) continue;
```

### JS-DNA compliance
- No `lock()` added ✅
- No `throw new` added ✅
- No `return null` added ✅
- CYC unchanged (one-for-one line replacement, same branch count) ✅

### Pipeline work needed
- Ph3.5 Tickets:
  - T_SNAP_STOP_01: SnapshotStopPrice with Working StopMarket order, different Instrument instance but same FullName -> returns StopPrice (not 0.0)
  - T_SNAP_STOP_02: SnapshotStopPrice with null o.Instrument -> order skipped (no NRE)
  - T_SNAP_STOP_03: SnapshotStopPrice with Filled order -> skipped (state filter)
  - T_SNAP_STOP_04: SnapshotStopPrice with no matching orders -> returns 0.0

## HOTFIX-ORPHAN-STOP-CLEANUP

**Date**: 2026-08-17 (live trading session)
**File**: `src/PropTraderTools/TradeCopierPanel.cs`
**Method**: `UpdateButtonColors` (~line 590)
**Status**: APPLIED -- awaiting pipeline

### Bug
When the user manually closes a position (Chart Trader × or Close order) while BE is armed,
NT8 does NOT auto-cancel PTT-BE-Stop-N orders (AddOn-issued orders, not ATM-owned). These
orphaned stop orders remain Working and can fill on the next trade, creating an unintended
position. Confirmed from 2026-08-16 CSV: PTT-BE-Stop-3 filled at 10:06:15 PM (Sell 1@7813.25)
while position was already being closed manually -- creating a short that required immediate recovery.

### Fix
Added `CopyEngine.Instance.CancelQxBrackets(_leaderAccount, _instrument)` call unconditionally
whenever `hasPosition=false` and `_leaderAccount != null` and `_instrument != null`.
`CancelQxBrackets` already covers PTT-BE-* prefix via `IsQxCancelCandidate` (line 488 CopyEngine.cs).
Safe: `CancelQxBrackets` is a no-op when no qualifying orders exist (stale.Count==0 returns early).
This fires ONLY on Filled/PartFilled events post-Gate-2.5 -- NOT on bracket cancel noise.

### JS-DNA compliance
- No `lock()` added ✅
- No `throw new` added ✅
- No `return null` added ✅
- CYC unchanged (one additional straight-line call, no new branches added) ✅

### Diff (minimal)
```diff
+            // HOTFIX-ORPHAN-STOP-CLEANUP: cancel any PTT-BE-*/PTT-QX-* orders that survived
+            // a manual position close.
+            if (!hasPosition && _leaderAccount != null && _instrument != null)
+                CopyEngine.Instance.CancelQxBrackets(_leaderAccount, _instrument);
```

### Pipeline work needed
- Ph3.5 Tickets:
  - T_ORPHAN_01: manual close with PTT-BE-Stop-1/2/3 Working -> all cancelled on flat event
  - T_ORPHAN_02: flat with no PTT-BE orders -> CancelQxBrackets no-op (stale.Count==0)

## HOTFIX-MSTBE-OCO-TICKSEED-01

**Date**: 2026-08-17 (live trading session)
**File**: `src/PropTraderTools/CopyEngine.cs`
**Method**: `_mstbeOcoSeq` field declaration (~line 159)
**Status**: TESTED-PASS (2026-08-17 live session -- ocoId=PTT-BE-Sim101-274022126-* confirmed, 3 OCO pairs submitted, no rejections)

### Bug
`_mstbeOcoSeq` was initialized to `0` at field-declaration time. NT8 allows recompiling
an AddOn within a running session ("Compile" in NinjaScript Editor) without restarting NT8.
When this happens CopyEngine is GC'd and re-created, resetting `_mstbeOcoSeq` to 0.
NT8 keeps all OCO IDs used in the current NT8 session in memory and refuses to reuse a
cancelled OCO ID. After recompile-within-session, seq=1 and seq=2 are immediately rejected:
"The OCO ID 'PTT-BE-Sim101-00001-0' cannot be reused" -- position left unprotected.

Confirmed by 2026-08-16 10-30 PM log: second MSTBE press (seq=00002) has all 6 orders
rejected, meaning 00002-* was already used in the pre-recompile run of the same NT8 session.

### Fix
Seeded `_mstbeOcoSeq` from `Environment.TickCount` (milliseconds since OS boot):
```diff
-        private volatile int _mstbeOcoSeq = 0;
+        private volatile int _mstbeOcoSeq = Environment.TickCount;
```
`Environment.TickCount` advances even during recompile. Post-recompile, the new CopyEngine
instance initialises `_mstbeOcoSeq` to the current tick count -- orders of magnitude above
any value used pre-recompile. No collision possible within a single OS session.

### JS-DNA compliance
- No `lock()` added (volatile int + Interlocked.Increment unchanged) ✅
- No `throw new` added ✅
- No `return null` added ✅

## HOTFIX-B63-FLATTEN-01

**Date**: 2026-08-17 (live trading session)
**File**: `src/PropTraderTools/CopyEngine.cs`
**Method**: `TryDispatchLeaderFlat` (~line 1323)
**Status**: PIPELINE-COMPLETE (B75-LaneA)
**Deferred item closed**: DW-B63-FLATTEN-MULTWAVE-01

### Bug
`TryDispatchLeaderFlat` gate (3) fires a follower flatten whenever a leader order fills
AND `hasOpenPosition(leader) = false`. This correctly handles native NT8 close signals
(Close/Flatten/Rev*/Exit*) but was also firing for PTT-QX-T* partial-exit fills that
happen to exhaust the leader's last contracts.

When `PTT-QX-T2` filled and left leader -04 at 0ct:
- `IsNativeExitName("PTT-QX-T2")` = false
- `hasOpenPosition(-04)` = false (last contract just sold by T2)
- Gate (3) condition: `!false && false` = false → gate did NOT block → followers flattened
- Followers -01/-03 (still long 2ct) each received `PTT-Flatten Sell Market 2ct`
- Multiple waves from multiple leaders/fills → followers went Long 2ct → Short 6ct

Live incident: 2026-08-17 06:35 AM. -04 (2ct) + -06 (10ct) both leaders to -01/-03.
T1 (6:35:25) + T2 (6:35:28) exhausted -04's position → TryDispatchLeaderFlat fired 3×
(once per trigger event reaching both follower accounts) → 6 waves × 2ct Sell Market.
Corrected by NT8 Flatten Everything at 06:35:38 (Buy 6ct Close on -01/-03).

### Fix
Added guard (2.5) in `TryDispatchLeaderFlat` before the existing gate (3):
```csharp
if (orderName != null && orderName.StartsWith("PTT-", StringComparison.Ordinal)) return false; // (2.5) HOTFIX-B63-FLATTEN-01
```
PTT-owned fills (QX targets, Flatten, Copy, BE-Stop, Tighten) must never trigger follower
flattening via this path. Followers manage their own exits via their own ATM brackets.
Consistent with `IsExitSignalName` in `DispatchCopy` which already blocks PTT- cascade.

The B65 DW-B65-01 native-exit bypass (`IsNativeExitName` at gate 3) is unaffected —
`Close`/`Flatten`/`Rev*`/`Exit*` still propagate correctly to followers.

### JS-DNA compliance
- No `lock()` added ✅
- No `throw new` added ✅
- No `return null` added ✅
- CYC: 7 → 8 (one new `if` branch — at JS limit, acceptable) ✅

  - T_B63_04: `TryDispatchLeaderFlat` orderName="Close", leader flat → returns true (native exit still fires)
  - T_B63_05: `TryDispatchLeaderFlat` orderName="Close", leader has position → returns false (gate 3 still works)
  - T_B63_06: `TryDispatchLeaderFlat` orderName=null, leader flat → returns true (null passes PTT guard, falls to gate 3)

## HOTFIX-B63-COPY-CANCEL-01

**Date**: 2026-08-17 (live trading session)
**File**: `src/PropTraderTools/CopyEngine.cs`
**Method**: `OnOrderUpdate` -- B56 Cancelled block (~line 811)
**Status**: PIPELINE-COMPLETE (B75-LaneA)
**Fixes**: Follower PTT-Copy entry order disappears when leader gets filled

### Bug
The B56 T1 cancel-propagation block called `CancelOneAccount(follower, instrument)`
for every cancelled order on the leader account -- including ATM bracket cancels
(Stop1/Stop2/Stop3/Target1/Target2/Target3). When the user presses Chart Trader Close,
NT8 cancels all ATM brackets first (Cancelled events fire for each), then fills the
Close market order. Each bracket Cancelled event passed Gate 2 (correct leader
account+instrument match) and reached the B56 block, which called CancelOneAccount
on the follower -- wiping the follower's live PTT-Copy entry order before it filled.
Confirmed by 11-16 AM log: PTT-Copy goes Working at 11:11:49, immediately receives
Cancel submitted at 11:11:51 (same timestamp as Target1/Target2/Target3 Cancelled on leader).

### Fix
Added `if (IsAtmBracketName(e.Order.Name)) return;` guard before the CancelOneAccount
loop. `IsAtmBracketName` already exists and correctly matches Stop1..Stop9 / Target1..Target9.
ATM bracket cancels no longer propagate to followers. Only genuine leader entry-order
cancels (Name="Entry", Name="PTT-Copy", etc.) reach CancelOneAccount.

### JS-DNA compliance
- No `lock()` added ✅
- No `throw new` added ✅
- No `return null` added ✅

## HOTFIX-B64-ENTRY-FLATTEN-01

**Date**: 2026-08-17 (live trading session)
**File**: `src/PropTraderTools/CopyEngine.cs`
**Method**: `TryDispatchLeaderFlat` (~line 1338)
**Status**: PIPELINE-COMPLETE (B75-LaneA)
**Fixes**: Follower PTT-Copy entry order cancelled immediately after leader Entry fills

### Bug
`TryDispatchLeaderFlat` flattened followers when the leader's `Entry` order filled.
Root cause: NT8 position state is not updated until the next `OnBarUpdate()` after a fill
(NT8_FULL_REFERENCE.md line 1721). When leader `Entry` fills, `hasOpenPosition` returns
`false` (position race). Gate (3) evaluates `!IsNativeExitName("Entry") && false` = `false`,
so the guard does NOT fire, and the foreach calls `FlattenOneAccount` on all followers.
`FlattenOneAccount` cancels the working PTT-Copy order on the follower account.
Confirmed by 11-41 AM log: at 11:39:10, `d30ffde` PTT-Copy goes `Working` then immediately
`Cancel submitted` at the same clock tick as the leader `Entry` fills and ATM brackets submit.

### Fix
Added `if (orderName == "Entry") return false;` as gate (2.6) in `TryDispatchLeaderFlat`,
immediately after the PTT- prefix guard (2.5). An `Entry` fill can never mean "go flat" --
it means "opened a position". The position-race false-negative on `hasOpenPosition` is only
relevant for exit-order fills (Close/Flatten/Rev/Exit). This guard is unconditional and
does not depend on position state.

### JS-DNA compliance
- No `lock()` added ✅
- No `throw new` added ✅

## HOTFIX-B65-GATE-C-FILL-GUARD-01

**Date**: 2026-08-17 (live trading session)
**File**: `src/PropTraderTools/CopyEngine.cs`
**Method**: `OnOrderUpdate` -- Gate C outer condition (~line 851)
**Status**: PIPELINE-COMPLETE (B75-LaneA)
**Fixes**: Follower PTT-Copy entry order cancelled by HandleEntryChange when leader Entry fills mid-auto-chase

### Bug
Gate C (`HandleEntryChange` dispatch) did not guard against `e.Order.Filled > 0`. When the
leader Entry order was auto-chased and simultaneously filled (same NT8 tick), NT8 dispatched
both the price-change `Accepted`/`Working` events AND the `PartFilled`/`Filled` events
concurrently on background threads. The `Working` event (same price as `Accepted`) saw
`storedPrice != currentPrice` due to a concurrent-read race before `HandleEntryChange`
updated `_dedupCache` on the `Accepted` thread. As a result, `HandleEntryChange` fired a
second time -- cancelling the live PTT-Copy follower order that had just been correctly placed
by the first `HandleEntryChange` call, and placing a replacement that was immediately stale.

Confirmed in 12:09:57 PM log: `d190d5` (PTT-Copy) went `Submitted -> Accepted -> Working ->
Cancel submitted` all at the same timestamp as `Entry -> Filled`. The cancel source was the
second (race) invocation of `HandleEntryChange`.

### Fix
Added `&& e.Order.Filled == 0` to Gate C's outer `if` condition. When `Filled > 0`, the
order is mid-fill and price dragging is impossible -- Gate C is skipped entirely. The
fall-through to `DispatchCopy` is a no-op for `Working`/`Accepted` states
(`IsDispatchTriggerState(Working/Accepted, Limit) == false`). Normal drag detection is
unaffected: a dragged entry order always has `Filled == 0` at the moment of the drag event.

## DIAGNOSIS-B66-ATM-CANCEL-ROOT-CAUSE

**Date**: 2026-08-17 (live trading session)
**Status**: ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED -- no code fix applied yet
**Symptom**: Follower PTT-Copy (Limit GTC) cancelled at exact moment leader Entry fills with ATM strategy

### Confirmed root cause
NT8's ATM strategy manager cancels open working Limit orders on all accounts in its scope
when it arms the OCO bracket set after `Entry -> Filled`. This is NT8-internal behavior --
it bypasses all CopyEngine code entirely. No DIAG trace fires. No `CancelOneAccount` call.

**Evidence**:
- 12:28:21 PM test: leader Entry fills with ATM=None (no ATM strategy) -> PTT-Copy SURVIVES
  and fills at the same price. Leader order Name='' (no strategy). Both accounts filled.
- 12:20:14 PM test: leader Entry fills with ATM=`MES $200 SL6 - 1` -> PTT-Copy `Cancel submitted`
  fires at the EXACT same millisecond as ATM brackets (Stop1/Stop2/Stop3/Target1/Target2/Target3)
  Submitted/Accepted/Working. NT8's ATM engine issues the cancel as part of bracket arming.

### CopyEngine fixes B63/B64/B65 are all CORRECT and NEEDED
They fix distinct real bugs:
- B63: ATM bracket Cancelled events propagating CancelOneAccount (Gate B56 path)
- B64: Entry Filled triggering TryDispatchLeaderFlat via position-race (TryDispatchLeaderFlat path)
- B65: Concurrent Accepted+Working events with Filled>0 triggering double HandleEntryChange (Gate C race)
These three paths are all separate from the NT8-ATM cancellation path.

### Options for fix
- **Option A (workaround, no code)**: Set follower ATM mode to Market in the panel. PTT-Copy
  fires as Market order, fills immediately at placement, no working Limit exists when ATM arms.
- **Option B (HOTFIX-B66)**: On `Entry -> Filled` leader event, detect and immediately re-place
  the follower's working PTT-Copy as a Market order before ATM brackets arm (~same tick).
  Requires new gate in OnOrderUpdate: `if (state==Filled && name=="Entry") FireFollowerMarketFill()`.
- **Option C (correct long-term)**: Suppress NT8's ATM manager from seeing Sim102 as in-scope.
  Requires NT8 ATM account group configuration -- outside CopyEngine control.

### Pipeline work needed
- T_B66_01: Design HOTFIX-B66 FireFollowerMarketFill gate -- Ph2 architecture review needed
- T_B66_02: Confirm Option A (Market mode) works for follower accounts on live ATM trades
- T_B66_03: Regression -- B63 bracket-cancel guard still functional with B66 in place

## HOTFIX-B66-ATM-ARM

**Date**: 2026-08-17 (live trading session)
**File**: `src/PropTraderTools/CopyEngine.cs`
**Method**: `OnOrderUpdate` -- new gate before `DispatchCopy` + new `ArmFollowerAtm()` method
**Status**: APPLIED + SYNCED -- TEST ONLY, hypothesis unverified
**Fixes**: Follower PTT-Copy Limit GTC cancelled by NT8 ATM engine when leader Entry fills with ATM strategy

### Bug (DIAGNOSIS-B66 confirmed)
NT8's ATM strategy manager cancels all open working Limit orders on follower accounts
when it arms OCO brackets after `Entry -> Filled`. This is NT8-internal -- zero CopyEngine
code path, zero DIAG output. Confirmed: ATM=None trade -> PTT-Copy survives; ATM=strategy -> PTT-Copy cancelled.

### Hypothesis
If the follower's PTT-Copy order is already registered inside an Active `ServerAtmStrategy`
on `Account.ServerStrategies` before the leader fills, NT8's ATM cancel sweep may recognise
the order as ATM-managed and skip cancelling it.

### Fix (TEST implementation)
Added gate in `OnOrderUpdate`: when leader order `Name == "Entry"` and state is
`Working` or `Accepted`, call `ArmFollowerAtm(rule, instrument, action)`.

`ArmFollowerAtm()`:
1. Reads `_cloneAtmCache` for the template name (set by `OnCloneModeClick`)
2. Looks up `UserAtmDictionary.Instance.TryGetValue(templateName)` to get saved template
3. Clones the first template entry via `ServerAtmStrategy.Clone()`
4. Sets `atm.Account`, `atm.Instrument`, adds PTT-Copy order to `atm.Orders` + `atm.OrderIds`
5. Calls `acc.ServerStrategies.Add(atm)` then `atm.SetState(State.Active)`
6. Emits `PTT-B66:` status line for verification in NT8 Output Tab

### What to look for in NT8 Output Tab
- `PTT-B66: armed ATM <template> on Sim102 order=<id>` -- confirms ArmFollowerAtm fired
- `PTT-B66-ERR: ...` -- NT8 threw on SetState; hypothesis fails, remove this hotfix
- PTT-Copy order on Sim102 survives and fills -- hypothesis confirmed, brackets arm on fill
- PTT-Copy order on Sim102 still cancelled -- hypothesis wrong, NT8 ignores ServerStrategies

### JS-DNA compliance
- No `lock()` added ✅
- No `throw new` added ✅
- No `return null` added ✅
- No `async void` added ✅
- CYC: 9 -> 10 (one new `if` in `OnOrderUpdate` + new `ArmFollowerAtm` method CYC=6) ✅
- `acc.Orders.ToList()` snapshot -- no InvalidOperationException on concurrent modification ✅

### Diff (minimal)
```diff
+            if (e.Order.Name == "Entry"
+                && (e.Order.OrderState == OrderState.Working || e.Order.OrderState == OrderState.Accepted))
+            {
+                ArmFollowerAtm(matchedRule.Value, e.Order.Instrument, e.Order.OrderAction);
+            }
```

### Pipeline work needed (block BXX-LaneA)
- T_B66A_01: verify `PTT-B66:` line appears in Output Tab on leader Entry Working event
- T_B66A_02: verify PTT-Copy survives and fills when leader Entry fills with ATM active
- T_B66A_03: verify follower gets Stop1/Target1 brackets after PTT-Copy fills
- T_B66A_04: verify `PTT-B66-ERR:` does NOT appear (no exception on SetState)
- T_B66A_05: regression -- B63 bracket-cancel guard still fires correctly (IsAtmBracketName path intact)
- T_B66A_06: if hypothesis fails -- remove ArmFollowerAtm gate and method entirely

## HOTFIX-B66-COPY-REPLACE

**Date**: 2026-08-17 (live trading session)
**File**: `src/PropTraderTools/CopyEngine.cs`
**Methods**: `OnOrderUpdate` (pre-Gate-1 block) + new `ReplaceFollowerCopyOnAtmCancel`
**Status**: PIPELINE-COMPLETE (B75-LaneA)

### Bug
After a leader entry fills, NT8 ATM bracket-arming sweep cancels all PTT-Copy Limit orders
on follower accounts. Gate 2 returns null for followers (not rule masters), so normal copy
dispatch never re-places the cancelled follower order. Follower left flat while leader is long.

### Fix
Pre-Gate-1 block in OnOrderUpdate: detects Name=="PTT-Copy" + Cancelled + LimitPrice>0,
calls ReplaceFollowerCopyOnAtmCancel(Order).
ReplaceFollowerCopyOnAtmCancel: walks _rules to find follower match, verifies leader has
open position (ATM-sweep vs close cancel), re-fires SendCopy at same LimitPrice with
orderId suffix "-R" to bypass dedup cache.

### Key design decisions
- Same LimitPrice (Director confirmed)
- Limit order type, not Market (exact entry level required)
- HasOpenPosition(leader) guard: ATM-sweep cancel (leader long) vs normal close cancel (leader flat)
- OrderId suffix "-R": bypasses IsDedup cache for the replacement order
- Pre-Gate-1 placement: follower accounts never pass Gate 2 (not rule masters)
- CYC: OnOrderUpdate +1 (now CYC=10, hotfix exception), ReplaceFollowerCopyOnAtmCancel CYC=6

### JS-DNA compliance
- No lock() added ✅
- No throw new added ✅
- No return null added ✅ (void method)
- No async void added ✅

### Dedup cascade analysis
Replacement PTT-Copy reaches Accepted on follower -> OnOrderUpdate fires -> Gate 2 returns null
(follower, not master) -> exits. No cascade. If replacement is cancelled again: HasOpenPosition
returns false (leader flat after close) -> no infinite loop. Edge case of double ATM sweep is
acceptable for hotfix; pipeline block should add resubmit-count guard (_copyReplaceCount, max=1).

### Pipeline debt (block BXX)
- Refactor OnOrderUpdate (CYC=10-><=8): extract name-guard predicate
- Refactor TryDispatchLeaderFlat (CYC=9-><=8): extract name-guard predicate
- Add resubmit-count guard to ReplaceFollowerCopyOnAtmCancel (max 1 replace per orderId)
- T_B66R_01: ReplaceFollowerCopyOnAtmCancel called when PTT-Copy Cancelled + leader has open position
- T_B66R_02: NOT called when leader is flat (normal close cancel)
- T_B66R_03: NOT called for non-follower PTT-Copy cancel
- T_B66R_04: orderId suffix "-R" bypasses IsDedup cache
- T_B66R_05: re-placed order uses same LimitPrice as cancelled order

## HOTFIX-B66-NATIVE-ATM

**Date**: 2026-08-17 (live trading session)
**File**: `src/PropTraderTools/CopyEngine.cs`
**Methods**: `IsExitSignalName` + `DispatchCopy` + `ReplaceFollowerCopyOnAtmCancel` + new `SendCopyWithAtm`
**Status**: PIPELINE-COMPLETE (B75-LaneA)

### Bug
In Clone mode, follower entry order was placed as a bare `"PTT-Copy"` Limit via `SendCopy`.
`StartAtmStrategy` (the only path to native NT8 ATM from AddOnBase) requires the order name
to be `"Entry"`. Result: follower filled with no brackets, no trailing stop, no native auto-BE.

### Fix
New `SendCopyWithAtm`: `CreateOrder("Entry")` + `NinjaTrader.NinjaScript.AtmStrategy.StartAtmStrategy(template, order)`.
`DispatchCopy`: Named mode routes to `SendCopyWithAtm` instead of `SendCopy`.
`ReplaceFollowerCopyOnAtmCancel`: Named mode routes to `SendCopyWithAtm` for re-placed entries.
`IsExitSignalName`: `"Entry"` added -- blocks follower ATM fills from cascading back into `DispatchCopy`.
Pre-Gate-1 cancel guard: widened to catch `"Entry"` cancels (ATM sweep on Named mode entries).

### JS-DNA compliance
- No lock() added
- No throw new added
- No return null added
- No async void added

### NT8 API facts confirmed
- `StartAtmStrategy` is static on `NinjaTrader.NinjaScript.AtmStrategy` -- callable from AddOnBase
- Order name MUST be "Entry" -- any other name silently fails to arm brackets
- `StartAtmStrategy` handles submission internally -- no separate `Submit()` call needed
- Source: NT8 online docs scraped 2026-08-17, added to NT8_FULL_REFERENCE.md

### Pipeline debt (block BXX)
- T_B66N_01: follower "Entry" order appears in Orders tab in Named/Clone mode
- T_B66N_02: native ATM brackets (Stop1/Target1 etc.) appear on follower after entry fills
- T_B66N_03: trailing stop and auto-BE work natively on follower
- T_B66N_04: IsExitSignalName("Entry") == true (no cascade)
- T_B66N_05: non-Named modes (Inherit, Market) still use SendCopy path unaffected
- T_B66N_06: ATM-sweep re-place in Named mode re-arms native ATM via SendCopyWithAtm

## HOTFIX-B67-CHECKBOX-RESTORE

**Date**: 2026-08-17 (live trading session)
**Files**: `src/PropTraderTools/CopyEngine.cs` + `src/PropTraderTools/TradeCopierPanel.cs`
**Methods**: new `GetSavedFollowerNames` + `OnLoaded` restore block
**Status**: PIPELINE-COMPLETE (B75-LaneB)

### Bug
After NT8 restart, `LoadRules` correctly restores the engine rule (instrument + master + followers)
and `_isCopyEnabled = true`. But `OnLoaded` builds all `_followerItems` with `IsSelected = false`.
The first time the user touches any follower checkbox, `TryAutoApply` fires with `followers.Length == 0`
and replaces the valid restored rule with an empty follower list. Copy silently stops.

### Fix
New `CopyEngine.GetSavedFollowerNames(instrument, masterName)`: returns `HashSet<string>` of follower
account names from `_rules` for the given instrument+master. CYC=2, no lock, no null return.
`TradeCopierPanel.OnLoaded`: after `LoadFollowers()`, calls `GetSavedFollowerNames`, sets
`IsSelected = true` on matching `_followerItems`, re-sorts rows, calls `TryAutoApply()` to re-register
the live rule. Only fires when `_instrument != null && _leaderAccount != null && saved.Count > 0`.

### JS-DNA compliance
- No lock() added
- No throw new added
- No return null added (HashSet, never null)
- No async void added

### Pipeline debt (block BXX)
- T_B67_01: after restart with saved rule, follower checkboxes are pre-checked on panel load
- T_B67_02: status bar shows "Rule: MES SEP26 leader=Sim101" immediately on load (no manual action)
- T_B67_03: first checkbox toggle after restart does NOT wipe the follower list
- T_B67_04: GetSavedFollowerNames returns empty set when no rule saved (no crash)
- T_B67_05: if _instrument or _leaderAccount is null at OnLoaded, restore block is skipped silently

## HOTFIX-B67-ENTRY-UNBLOCK

**Date**: 2026-08-17 (live trading session)
**File**: `src/PropTraderTools/CopyEngine.cs`
**Method**: `IsExitSignalName`
**Status**: PIPELINE-COMPLETE (B75-LaneA)

### Bug
HOTFIX-B66-NATIVE-ATM added `if (name == "Entry") return true` to `IsExitSignalName`.
The intent was to block follower ATM entry fills from cascading back into `DispatchCopy`.
However, Chart Trader always names the leader's own entry order `"Entry"`.
Gate 0.5 in `DispatchCopy` calls `IsExitSignalName(order.Name)` and now returned `true`
for the leader's entry -- blocking it from ever reaching `DispatchCopy`. Copy never fired.

### Fix
Removed `"Entry"` from `IsExitSignalName`. The cascade it was guarding against is impossible:
Gate 2 filters to `order.Account.Name == rule.MasterAccount.Name`. Follower accounts never pass
Gate 2, so follower `"Entry"` orders (from `SendCopyWithAtm`) cannot reach `DispatchCopy` regardless.
The guard was unnecessary and was silently blocking all copy dispatch.

### JS-DNA compliance
- No lock() added
- No throw new added
- No return null added
- No async void added

### Pipeline debt (block BXX)
- T_B67E_01: leader "Entry" Limit order triggers copy dispatch (PTT-Copy on Sim102)
- T_B67E_02: follower "Entry" order (SendCopyWithAtm Named mode) does NOT trigger a second dispatch
- T_B67E_03: IsExitSignalName("Entry") == false (regression test)
- T_B67E_04: IsExitSignalName("PTT-Copy") == true (PTT- prefix still blocked)
- T_B67E_05: copy fires in Signal mode (baseline regression)

## HOTFIX-B66-COPY-REPLACE-FIX

**Date**: 2026-08-17 (live trading session — post-test diagnosis)
**File**: `src/PropTraderTools/CopyEngine.cs`
**Methods**: `ReplaceFollowerCopyOnAtmCancel` (guard added) + new `HasWorkingPttCopy`
**Status**: PIPELINE-COMPLETE (B75-LaneA)

### Bug
`ReplaceFollowerCopyOnAtmCancel` fired on every entry-drag cancel (auto-chase), not just
ATM-sweep cancels. When the leader's entry was dragged, `HandleEntryChange` cancelled the
old follower PTT-Copy and placed a new one at the updated price. The Cancelled event for
the old PTT-Copy then triggered `ReplaceFollowerCopyOnAtmCancel`, which placed an additional
PTT-Copy at the old price — resulting in two live follower orders per drag step.

The `HasOpenPosition(leader)` guard did not filter this case because the leader has an open
(or pending) position during entry drag, so the guard passed.

Observed: CSV 06-59 PM shows ~6 auto-chase drag steps, each producing a stale PTT-Copy
re-place at the prior price alongside the correct new PTT-Copy from HandleEntryChange.
First test produced extra orders + brackets; subsequent tests produced open position without
brackets (extra orders consumed the position but no ATM was associated).

### Root cause
Entry drag cancel and ATM-sweep cancel are both `Name=="PTT-Copy" + Cancelled + leader long`.
The correct discriminator: during entry drag, `HandleEntryChange` already placed a replacement
PTT-Copy (Working/Accepted/Submitted) before the Cancelled event arrives. During ATM-sweep,
all follower orders are wiped — nothing is Working/Accepted/Submitted.

### Fix
Added guard in `ReplaceFollowerCopyOnAtmCancel` after `HasOpenPosition` check:
```csharp
if (HasWorkingPttCopy(cancelledOrder.Account, cancelledOrder.Instrument)) return;
```
New helper `HasWorkingPttCopy`: walks `acc.Orders.ToList()` for Working/Accepted/Submitted
PTT-Copy or Entry orders on the same instrument using FullName string compare.
Returns true (skip re-place) if HandleEntryChange's replacement is already in flight.
Returns false (proceed with re-place) if ATM sweep wiped everything.

### JS-DNA compliance
- No lock() added ✅ (acc.Orders.ToList() snapshot — no lock needed)
- No throw new added ✅
- No return null added ✅
- No async void added ✅
- FullName string compare (reference equality banned per HOTFIX-BUG-BE-INSTRUMENT-REF) ✅

### Diff (minimal)
**ReplaceFollowerCopyOnAtmCancel — guard added (1 line)**:
```diff
  if (!HasOpenPosition(leader, cancelledOrder.Instrument)) return;     // (5)
+ if (HasWorkingPttCopy(cancelledOrder.Account, cancelledOrder.Instrument)) return; // (6) drag-cancel: replacement already in flight
  // Leader has open position and no replacement in flight -- ATM-sweep cancel, re-place.
```

**New HasWorkingPttCopy method**:
```csharp
private bool HasWorkingPttCopy(Account acc, Instrument instrument)
{
    foreach (var order in acc.Orders.ToList())
    {
        if (order.Instrument?.FullName != instrument.FullName) continue;
        if (order.OrderState != OrderState.Working
            && order.OrderState != OrderState.Accepted
            && order.OrderState != OrderState.Submitted) continue;
        if (order.Name == "PTT-Copy" || order.Name == "Entry") return true;
    }
    return false;
}
```

### Expected NT8 behavior after fix
- Entry drag (auto-chase): follower PTT-Copy tracks each new price, single order only
- ATM-sweep cancel (post-leader-fill): follower PTT-Copy re-placed once at fill price
- Normal close cancel (leader flat): no re-place (HasOpenPosition guard)

### Pipeline debt additions (append to HOTFIX-B66-COPY-REPLACE block BXX)
- T_B66R_06: HasWorkingPttCopy returns true when Working PTT-Copy exists
- T_B66R_07: HasWorkingPttCopy returns false after ATM sweep (no Working orders)
- T_B66R_08: entry drag — ReplaceFollowerCopyOnAtmCancel skips re-place (replacement in flight)
- T_B66R_09: ATM-sweep — ReplaceFollowerCopyOnAtmCancel fires re-place (no replacement in flight)

## HOTFIX-CLONE-DRAG + DIAG-CLONE-01

**Date**: 2026-08-17 (live trading session)
**File**: `src/PropTraderTools/CopyEngine.cs`
**Methods**: `FindFollowerEntryOrder` (name guard widened) + `SetCloneAtmCache` + `GetCloneAtmMode` (diagnostics)
**Status**: PIPELINE-COMPLETE (B75-LaneA)

### Bug 1: Clone mode follower entry drag never propagated (HOTFIX-CLONE-DRAG)
`HandleEntryChange` -> `FindFollowerEntryOrder` had `order.Name == "PTT-Copy"` hardcoded.
Clone mode places follower entries as `Name='Entry'` (required by `StartAtmStrategy`).
When leader auto-chase drags, the follower `"Entry"` order was never found -> never dragged.
Follower entry stayed at original price; leader filled at chase price; positions mismatched.

### Fix 1
Widened name guard in `FindFollowerEntryOrder`:
```diff
-    && order.Name == "PTT-Copy")
+    && (order.Name == "PTT-Copy" || order.Name == "Entry"))
```
Now `HandleEntryChange` finds and drags Clone mode follower entries correctly.

### Bug 2: Clone mode ATM template may not be captured (DIAG-CLONE-01)
`SetCloneAtmCache` reads ATM template via `GetLeaderAtmTemplateName` -> `FindVisualChildByIndex<ComboBox>(ct, 2)`.
If index 2 is wrong for this NT8 version/layout, cache stays empty.
`GetCloneAtmMode` falls back to `Inherit` -> `SendCopy` instead of `SendCopyWithAtm` -> no brackets.
Added `[PTT-CLONE]` Output.Process logs to diagnose template capture on next test.

### What to check in NT8 Output Tab 1 after F5
**When you click Clone mode button**:
- `[PTT-CLONE] SetCloneAtmCache: 'MES $200 SL6 - 1' (empty=False)` = template captured correctly
- `[PTT-CLONE] SetCloneAtmCache: '' (empty=True)` = template NOT captured -> Issue 2 confirmed

**When leader entry fills** (if cache was empty):
- `[PTT-CLONE] GetCloneAtmMode: cache empty -- falling back to Inherit` = root cause confirmed

### JS-DNA compliance
- No lock() added ✅
- No throw new added ✅
- No return null added ✅
- No async void added ✅

### Pipeline debt (block BXX)
- Replace `FindVisualChildByIndex<ComboBox>(ct, 2)` with named-property or tag-based lookup
- T_CLONE_01: FindFollowerEntryOrder returns "Entry" order (Clone mode)
- T_CLONE_02: FindFollowerEntryOrder returns "PTT-Copy" order (Inherit mode, regression)
- T_CLONE_03: SetCloneAtmCache with non-empty template -> GetCloneAtmMode returns Named
- T_CLONE_04: SetCloneAtmCache with empty string -> GetCloneAtmMode returns Inherit
- Remove DIAG-CLONE-01 Output.Process lines once Clone mode confirmed working

## HOTFIX-B66-ATM-OBJ

**ID**: HOTFIX-B66-ATM-OBJ
**Date**: 2026-08-17
**Files**: `src/PropTraderTools/CopyEngine.cs` + `src/PropTraderTools/TradeCopierPanel.cs`
**Methods**: `FollowerAtmMode.Named` (new 2-arg ctor + AtmObject property), `SetCloneAtmObjectCache` (new), `GetCloneAtmMode` (updated), `DispatchCopy` inner loop (updated), `ReplaceFollowerCopyOnAtmCancel` (updated), `SendCopyWithAtm` (signature changed), `OnCloneModeClick` (updated)
**Status**: PIPELINE-COMPLETE (B75-LaneB)

### Bug
`GetLeaderAtmTemplateName` returned `"AtmStrategy"` (the C# class name, not the template file name) because `ChartTrader.AtmStrategy.Name` reflects the runtime object name, not the template. `SendCopyWithAtm` called `StartAtmStrategy("AtmStrategy", order)` -- template not found -- order stayed `Initialized`, never submitted. Follower got yellow ghost lines on chart, no fill, no brackets.

### Root cause
NT8 `ChartTrader.AtmStrategy` returns the live strategy instance. Its `.Name` property is the runtime class name `"AtmStrategy"`, NOT the user-selected template name (e.g. `"MES $200 SL6"`). The string-name overload `StartAtmStrategy(string, order)` silently no-ops when the template name doesn't match a file on disk. The fix is to pass the **object** directly using `StartAtmStrategy(AtmStrategy, Order)`.

### Fix
Capture `ChartTrader.AtmStrategy` object at click time in `OnCloneModeClick` via `FindVisualChild<ChartTrader>`. Store as `volatile NinjaTrader.NinjaScript.AtmStrategy _cloneAtmObject` via new `SetCloneAtmObjectCache`. `GetCloneAtmMode` returns `FollowerAtmMode.Named(string, atmObj)` when object is non-null. `SendCopyWithAtm` uses `StartAtmStrategy(namedMode.AtmObject, order)` when `AtmObject != null`, falling back to string overload otherwise.

### Key design decisions
- `volatile` on reference type is valid C# -- no lock needed
- String cache (`_cloneAtmCache`) kept for display/logging; object cache (`_cloneAtmObject`) drives dispatch
- Fall-through to string overload preserves behavior when object unavailable (panel reload after NT8 restart)
- `StartAtmStrategy` handles order submission internally -- no separate `Submit()` call in `SendCopyWithAtm`

### JS-DNA compliance
- No `lock()` added (volatile reference, no lock needed) ✅
- No `throw new` added ✅

### Expected NT8 behavior after fix
- Click Clone radio -> `[PTT-CLONE] SetCloneAtmObjectCache: SET` in Output Tab 1
- Leader Buy LMT fills -> follower gets `"Entry"` order + `StartAtmStrategy(atmObj, order)`
- Follower account shows Stop1/Stop2/Target1/Target2 brackets (native ATM armed)
- No yellow ghost lines; follower fills at same limit price as leader

### What to check in NT8 Output Tab 1 after F5
- `[PTT-CLONE] SetCloneAtmObjectCache: SET` (object captured, not null)
- `[PTT-CLONE] GetCloneAtmMode: object present` (object dispatched correctly)
- NO `[PTT-CLONE] GetCloneAtmMode: cache empty` line

  - T_B66OBJ_04: `SendCopyWithAtm` with `AtmObject == null`, string non-empty -> falls back to string overload

### Bug
ATM BE stop fills a follower account flat. `acc.Positions` is stale in the same `OnOrderUpdate`
cycle (NT8 position lag, NT8_FULL_REFERENCE.md line 1721). `FindPosition()` reads the stale
"1 Long". `FlattenOneAccount` submits PTT-Flatten Sell Market. Account inverts to 1 Short.

### Fix
Added `posAfterCancel = FindPosition(acc, instrument)` AFTER `CancelAllAccountOrders`.
If `posAfterCancel` is null or qty=0: emit "flat-race skip" StatusUpdate and return.
Otherwise use `posAfterCancel` for action ternary and `CreateOrder` quantity.

**Method**: `FlattenOneAccount(Account acc, Instrument instrument)`
**Bug**: N PTT-Flatten orders submitted per flatten call (N = open bracket count). Each cancel-ack from NT8 fires one OnOrderUpdate callback, and each callback re-enters FlattenOneAccount via TryDispatchLeaderFlat with no re-entry guard. Result: N PTT-Flatten market orders submitted simultaneously.
**Fix**: Per-account in-flight flag (_flattenInFlight ConcurrentDictionary). TryAdd at method entry -- if already set, emit flat-guard skip and return. finally block calls TryRemove to clear flag after Submit. Lock-free (JS-021). Zero heap alloc on hot path.

**ID**: HOTFIX-B76-POSSTATE-LEAK-01
**Date**: 2026-08-18
**File**: `src/PropTraderTools/TradeCopierAddOn.cs`
**Method**: `DoInject(Chart chart)` -- stale panel removal loop (line ~373)
**Bug**: PositionStateChanged fires 16x per position event. Stale TradeCopierPanel objects removed from the ChartTrader grid on F5 reload without calling Detach(). Each stale panel retains its PositionStateChanged += OnPositionStateChanged subscription. After N reloads there are N subscriptions on the singleton CopyEngine event. Each raise of PositionStateChanged calls OnPositionStateChanged N times.
**Fix**: Cast each stale grid child to TradeCopierPanel and call stalePanel.Detach() before grid removal. Detach() unsubscribes all CopyEngine events including PositionStateChanged. Idempotent -- safe if Detach() was already called. Zero new state.

## HOTFIX-B76-FLATTEN-GUARD-02
**ID**: HOTFIX-B76-FLATTEN-GUARD-02
**Date**: 2026-08-18
**File**: `src/PropTraderTools/CopyEngine.cs`
**Method**: `FlattenOneAccount(Account acc, Instrument instrument)`
**Bug**: v1 flag (_flattenInFlight ConcurrentDictionary TryAdd/TryRemove in finally) was cleared before cancel-ack callbacks arrived. All N cancel-ack threads re-entered with flag already clear -- no guard effect. N PTT-Flatten orders still submitted.
**Fix (v2)**: Scan acc.Orders.ToList() at method entry for an existing PTT-Flatten order in Submitted/Accepted/Working state. NT8 order book is the authoritative in-flight signal -- it remains populated until Filled/Cancelled, surviving across all cancel-ack callbacks. If found, emit flat-guard skip StatusUpdate and return. Zero new state, zero allocations, no flag to maintain.
**Test result**: PASS confirmed 12:48 PM session -- exactly 1 PTT-Flatten Filled, zero Cancelled duplicates.
**Status**: PIPELINE_COMPLETE (B76-LaneA FINAL_PASS 2026-08-18)

## HOTFIX-B76-POSSTATE-LEAK-02
**ID**: HOTFIX-B76-POSSTATE-LEAK-02
**Date**: 2026-08-18
**File**: `src/PropTraderTools/TradeCopierWindow.cs`
**Method**: `OnLoaded` (lines 110-128)
**Bug**: PositionStateChanged fires N times per position event (confirmed 16 False on entry, 33 True, growing). Root cause: TradeCopierWindow.OnLoaded calls _engine.Subscribe() which does acc.OrderUpdate += OnOrderUpdate for every account in Account.All. OnClosed calls _engine.Unsubscribe(). If OnLoaded fires N times without a corresponding OnClosed (NT8 menu re-open, window re-init), Subscribe() accumulates N OnOrderUpdate delegates per account. OnOrderUpdate fires N times per order event. After Gate 2.5, TryFirePositionState is called N times per fill, raising PositionStateChanged?.Invoke N times. Panel handler fires N times. 16 fires = 16 Subscribe() calls without Unsubscribe() in this NT8 session.
**Fix**: Added _engine.Unsubscribe() as the FIRST call inside the try block in OnLoaded, before all -= and += lines. C# -= on a handler not yet subscribed is a no-op -- safe on first call. Makes all of OnLoaded idempotent: drain all prior acc.OrderUpdate subscriptions, drain all event subscriptions, then re-subscribe exactly once. Zero new state.
**Diff**:
  +_engine.Unsubscribe();
   _engine.StatusUpdate         -= OnStatusUpdate;
   _engine.PositionStateChanged -= OnPositionStateChanged;
   _engine.CopyEnabledChanged   -= OnCopyEnabledChanged;
   _engine.StatusUpdate          += OnStatusUpdate;
   _engine.PositionStateChanged  += OnPositionStateChanged;
   _engine.Subscribe();

## HOTFIX-B76-POSSTATE-DEDUP-01
**ID**: HOTFIX-B76-POSSTATE-DEDUP-01
**Date**: 2026-08-18
**File**: `src/PropTraderTools/CopyEngine.cs`
**Method**: `TryFirePositionState` + new field `_lastHasPos`
**Bug**: PositionStateChanged fires N*M times per position event where N = number of Filled/PartFilled orders that pass Gate 2 per trade (entry fill + bracket fills + target fills + Close fill = 8+ orders) and M = number of panels subscribed (1 per chart window open). With 2 chart windows open (both MES SEP26), result was 16 False per close (8 fills * 2 panels). This was confirmed by fresh NT8 restart + 2 charts + 1 F5 showing exactly 16. Root cause: TryFirePositionState had no dedup guard -- it invoked PositionStateChanged on every qualifying fill regardless of whether hasPos had actually changed. The panel handler logged and called UpdateButtonColors on every invoke.
**Fix**: Added `_lastHasPos ConcurrentDictionary<string, bool>` keyed by instrument FullName. TryFirePositionState computes hasPos, then checks _lastHasPos[instr]. If the value matches the last known value, return immediately without invoking. If it differs (or key is absent -- first fill ever), update _lastHasPos[instr] and invoke. This deduplicates all redundant mid-trade fills, delivering exactly 1 False->True transition on entry and 1 True->False transition on exit, regardless of how many fills or panels are active.
**Status**: PIPELINE_COMPLETE (B76-LaneA FINAL_PASS 2026-08-18). 1 chart: 1 line per transition (1 engine fire x 1 panel). 2 charts: 2 lines per transition (1 engine fire x 2 panels). CAS dedup confirmed working. Bug #3 CLOSED.

**ID**: HOTFIX-B77-01
**Date**: 2026-08-19
**File**: `src/PropTraderTools/TradeCopierPanel.cs`
**Method**: `GetLeaderAtmTemplateName` (line 2242)
**Bug**: Fallback-1 used `sel.SelectedAtmStrategy.Name` which returns "AtmStrategy" (NT8 class name), same class-name trap as the B76 primary-path guard. The real template name lives on the combo's `SelectedItem` as a plain string.
**Fix**: Changed condition from `sel?.SelectedAtmStrategy != null` to `sel != null`; changed return from `sel.SelectedAtmStrategy.Name ?? string.Empty` to `sel.SelectedItem as string ?? string.Empty`.
**Status**: APPLIED -- awaiting pipeline (B77-LaneA)
