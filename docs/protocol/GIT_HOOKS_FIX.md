# Git Hooks Fix (2026-06-01)

## Issue
Bob Shell's post-commit hook was failing with error:
```
error: cannot spawn .git/hooks/post-commit: No such file or directory
```

## Root Cause
The hook script at `.git/hooks/post-commit` was missing the shebang line (`#!/bin/bash`) at the top of the file. Lines 1-2 were empty, causing Git for Windows to fail when trying to execute the script.

## Fix Applied
Added proper shebang line at line 1:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
```

## Verification
- Git Bash exists at: `C:\Program Files\Git\bin\bash.exe`
- Hook script is now executable by Git for Windows
- Bob Shell notes functionality restored

## Impact
- **Before**: Hook failed silently, Bob notes not attached to commits
- **After**: Hook executes successfully, git notes synced properly
