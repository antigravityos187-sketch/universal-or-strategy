# Complexity Reduction Protocol (V12.22)

## Mandatory Thresholds (No Questions Asked)

### Primary Gate: CYC ≤ 8 (BLOCKING)
**Rule**: ALL methods MUST be reduced to CYC ≤ 8 before merge.
- **Enforcement**: Pre-push validation (Check #9) - BLOCKING
- **Tool**: `complexity_audit.py`
- **Rationale**: Jane Street GODMODE - cognitive simplicity for microsecond-latency code
- **Note**: Legacy threshold 15 deprecated as of V12.23

### Stretch Goal: CYC ≤ 10 (Boy Scout Rule)
**Rule**: If achievable within the same extraction pass WITHOUT adding new helpers, reduce to ≤10.
- **Enforcement**: Advisory (Codacy warnings)
- **When**: During the SAME refactoring session, if the natural extraction lands at 11-15
- **Don't**: Create artificial splits just to hit 10 if 15 is already achieved

### Aspirational: CYC ≤ 8 (Future Debt Reduction)
**Rule**: Track in EPIC-CCN-10 backlog, not a current gate.
- **Enforcement**: None (Lizard tool advisory only)
- **When**: Dedicated debt-reduction sprints after EPIC-14

## Decision Tree (No Director Approval Needed)

```
Current CYC > 20?
├─ YES → Extract to CYC ≤ 8 (REQUIRED)
│  └─ Natural result ≤ 8? → DONE (gate passed)
│  └─ Natural result 9-20? → Extract further (gate failed)
└─ NO (CYC 9-20) → Extract to CYC ≤ 8 (REQUIRED)
   └─ Same decision tree as above
```

**Key Principle**: Extract until ≤15. If you land at ≤10 naturally, great. If you land at 11-15, stop.

---

## Practical Examples

### Example 1: T-W1-Perf (CYC 31 → ?)
**Current**: 31 (CRITICAL-REFACTOR)
**Action**: Extract helpers until parent ≤ 15
**Likely Outcome**: 
- Parent: 12-15 (PASS - stop here)
- Helpers: 8-10 each (natural result)

**Don't**: Force parent to 10 if it naturally lands at 13 after clean extraction.

### Example 2: OnKeyDown (CYC 49 → ?)
**Current**: 49 (CRITICAL-REFACTOR)
**Action**: Command Pattern extraction
**Likely Outcome**:
- Dispatcher: 5-8 (routing only)
- Handlers: 8-12 each (business logic)

**Don't**: Split handlers further if they land at 11-12.

### Example 3: Method at CYC 17
**Current**: 17 (above gate)
**Action**: Extract ONE helper to drop parent to ≤15
**Likely Outcome**: Parent 14, Helper 8

**Don't**: Extract multiple helpers to force parent to 8.

## Parallel Execution Strategy

### When to Parallelize
**Rule**: Parallelize when files DO NOT overlap.

**Safe Parallel Pairs** (from current queue):
- ✅ T-W1-Perf (SIMA.Fleet.cs) + GAP-2 (Photon.Ring.cs) - different files
- ❌ T-W1-Perf (SIMA.Fleet.cs) + GAP-5 (SIMA.Fleet.cs) - SAME FILE

### Parallel Execution Protocol
1. **Check file overlap** using jCodemunch `search_symbols`
2. **If no overlap**: Use 2 Bob Shell windows (different branches)
3. **If overlap**: Sequential execution (first-complete, first-merge)

### Coordination
- **Window 1**: Bob Shell #1 (`bob --mode v12-engineer`)
- **Window 2**: Bob Shell #2 (`bob --mode v12-engineer`)
- **Orchestrator**: Bob IDE (Advanced mode) - monitors both, coordinates F5 gates

---

## Bob Shell Mode Clarification

### Standard Bob Modes (Built-in)
- `orchestrator` - Multi-agent coordination (YES, this exists)
- `architect` - Planning only
- `code` - General coding

### V12 Custom Modes (`.bob/custom_modes.yaml`)
- `v12-epic-planner` - Epic planning (docs/ only)
- `v12-engineer` - Architect + Engineer unified (src/ access)
- `v12-phase7-lead` - Legacy Phase 7 mode

### Correct Usage for T-W1-Perf
**Option A: Single-agent execution**
```bash
bob --mode v12-engineer
```

**Option B: Multi-agent coordination (parallel execution)**
```bash
# Terminal 1
bob --mode orchestrator
# Then delegate to v12-engineer agents in separate windows
```

## Master Roadmap Parallel Execution Plan

### Current Queue (Post-Phase-7)
| Task | File | CYC | Parallel Group |
|------|------|-----|----------------|
| T-W1-Perf | SIMA.Fleet.cs:407 | 31 | Group A |
| GAP-5 | SIMA.Fleet.cs:300 | N/A | Group A (CONFLICT) |
| GAP-2 | Photon.Ring.cs | N/A | Group B |

**Conflict Detected**: T-W1-Perf and GAP-5 both touch SIMA.Fleet.cs

**Resolution**:
1. **Clarify GAP-5 status** (roadmap says CLOSED, task.md says NEXT)
2. **If GAP-5 is truly needed**: Sequential (T-W1-Perf → GAP-5)
3. **If GAP-5 is obsolete**: Parallel (T-W1-Perf + GAP-2)

### Parallel Execution Template
```bash
# Window 1: Bob Orchestrator (monitoring)
bob --mode orchestrator

# Window 2: Agent 1 (T-W1-Perf)
bob --mode v12-engineer
# Branch: feature/src-tw1-perf-linq-optimization

# Window 3: Agent 2 (GAP-2)
bob --mode v12-engineer
# Branch: feature/src-gap2-spsc-integration
```

## Summary: No More Questions Protocol

### For ANY complexity reduction task:
1. ✅ **Target**: CYC ≤ 15 (BLOCKING gate)
2. ✅ **Bonus**: CYC ≤ 10 if achieved naturally
3. ✅ **Stop**: When gate is passed (don't over-optimize)
4. ✅ **Parallel**: Check file overlap, parallelize if safe
5. ✅ **Mode**: Use `orchestrator` for multi-agent, `v12-engineer` for single-agent

### Agents NEVER need to ask:
- ❌ "Should I target 10 or 15?" → **Answer: 15 (stop if you hit 10 naturally)**
- ❌ "Can I parallelize?" → **Answer: Check file overlap, parallelize if no conflict**
- ❌ "Which mode?" → **Answer: `orchestrator` for coordination, `v12-engineer` for execution**
